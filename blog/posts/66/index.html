  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m mad as hell.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just&nbsp;because the homeowners association that I pay over $200 combined a month is suing me for $5000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just&nbsp;because in a year I&#8217;ve been laid off three times, and left the one good company that I should have stayed at (said company also has a no-rehire policy).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just because crazy religious zealots who think it&#8217;s just fine to kill innocent people in the name of God make me wonder about the day to day safety of my future children.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just&nbsp;because after 20 years my parents are getting a divorce.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mad as hell because&nbsp;of all those things, and because&nbsp;someone stole my skateboard. One of my only escapes from reality has been removed from me, and I can&#8217;t afford the $100.00 to replace it. I sure hope I don&#8217;t see some kid riding it. That&#8217;s a sure fire way of turning Michael Buffington into Michael Douglas in Falling Down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been dipping my toes into C++ development here and there for a while, but I&#8217;ve never really taken a running cannon ball into the deep end. One of the things that&#8217;s slowed me down is what I see as the shear complexity of it. I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t make it much easier by having&nbsp;several languages rolled into their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/" target="_blank">development software</a><p>.</p><br />
<p>Well, tonight I found a great program to do C++ development in. It&#8217;s an <span class="caps">IDE</span> (for those who aren&#8217;t into programming, an <span class="caps">IDE</span> is code for <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=integrated%20development%20environment" target="_blank">Integrated Development Environment</a>, which is fancy talk for a text editor with nice gizmos) with a built in compiler. Actually, it&#8217;s not built in, but the installer installs a custom version of the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">GCC</span></a> compiler, which is a free compiler. The <span class="caps">IDE</span> is called <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/" target="_blank">Bloodshed DevC++</a>. The program is pretty small (under 10MB) unlike Microsoft&#8217;s environment which comes on several CD&#8217;s.</p><br />
<p>This development environment frees me up from a lot of concerns I have about compiling. It makes things a lot simpler, and let&#8217;s me focus on learning the code. While C++ still seems big to me, it&#8217;s smaller now that I have a streamlined development environment to work with.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m not the type who bashes someone over the head claiming that Linux and Open Source is the way to go. I usually prefer using software that gets the job done, whether it costs money, is free, or is written on napkins before being transcribed into digital form. Lately though, I&#8217;ve been running across a lot of fast, small, well written and solid programs, and I&#8217;m beginning to get the feeling that the big boys like Microsoft (and most other large software vendors) are losing me to small independent shops. Pretty soon, aside from my OS, I could be 100% Microsoft free. The only reason I stick with the MS OS is that I know it well, and it works for me. That&#8217;s not to say I couldn&#8217;t feel just as comfortable on another OS, only time will tell.</p><br />
<p>A former coworker and I used to argue about whether or not Microsoft truly had/has a monopoly or not, and my argument was &#8220;No.&#8221; He had a hard time dealing with that, what with government rulings and such. I explained to him that because I have a choice of what software I use, Microsoft, in my opinion, didn&#8217;t/doesn&#8217;t have a monopoly, and finding good software written by completely independent developers&nbsp;supports that argument for me. His points were somewhat valid too, but not so much to sway me.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to write because I&#8217;ve been busy writing code and doing some tech editing. </p>
<p>A year ago today I was at a barbeque in New Jersey with a bunch of random strangers who were staying at the same extended stay hotel I was. No one really wanted to get to know eachother, as we were all in sort of temporary situations. But there was a karoke machine, and quite a few people belted out a few tunes. Some little girl sang the strangest, most hypnotic song I&#8217;ve ever heard. It was the kind of thing that you&#8217;d hear in a horror movie as the bad guy is making a trophy out of the teeth of his victims.</p>
<p>Time certainly does fly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night as I was driving home&nbsp;I was suddenly attacked by the extreme stench of skunk. Now, I know what a skunk smells like, but this time the smell was an attack. I was gagging, my eyes were burning, my nose was running. My head was being assaulted the smells was so strong.</p>
<p>Within&nbsp;a few seconds of driving forward, I discovered the source. There on the side of the street was a standoff between a skunk, a lady, and a german shepard. The skunk was in full spray position. It occurred to me for a split second that I might be able to do something to rescue this lady, but that thought was clobbered in the head by the incredible stink. If, in my car driving by, it smelled that bad, there was no way I was letting her or the dog near me. My good samaritan attitude got it&#8217;s butt kicked by stench.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m sure is the case with any layoff, one spends a lot of time thinking about why it happened, what could have been different, and all that mumbo jumbo. I&#8217;ve decided it doesn&#8217;t matter, any thought towards trying to fix the unfixable is&nbsp;greatly unproductive, unless it teaches some profound lesson that might be useful in the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to be out on my own again, it seems like it was just a little while ago that I was in the same position. I spent a lot of time being bitter about the <a href="#pricefootnote">collapse</a> <p>of Price.com the last time, and it really did me no good. This time, I&#8217;m simply focused on providing for my family. With a child coming it&#8217;s almost like I have this insane, nearly frantic, motivation to provide security for the future. Being bitter and angst ridden simply weighs me down.</p><br />
<p>I truly enjoyed my experience with Autobytel. I&#8217;ve stepped foot in a lot of companies, and none were as thorough as Autobytel. The people there were warm and friendly. Everyone I worked with was very talented, and had no doubt been hired because of their talent and experience. The <span class="caps">CEO</span> was approachable, and offered individual praise to each of the 300+ employees. It is a good company, and like all companies it hits some rough spots. But the quality of this company compared to others will make the difference of whether or not it can ride out the rough spots. I have a feeling Autobytel will easily ride out spots rougher than laying off 40 employees. It just seems to be their nature.</p><br />
<p>It&#8217;s not fair to call it a collapse. It felt like one at the time. <a name="pricefootnote">Price.com</a> is still around, but barely. A little over a year ago, nearly all the staff was asked to take paycuts or to resign so that the company could ride out the rough weather. It was painful to see, especially after investing so much time and effort and sweat equity into the business. But, if the reality was ignored, meaning, if jobs weren&#8217;t cut back, it would surely be dead today. Today it still has the potential of making a return. It runs lean, and stays right where it needs to in order to ride out any rough spots. It&#8217;s the reality of business that sometimes layoffs must happen. Even family and quality of life orientend businesses like Autobytel and Price.com have to make these sacrifices sometimes.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted a new article in the <a href="coldfusion.cfm">ColdFusion</a> <p>section, and after doing so I&#8217;m suddenly painfully aware that I need a better way to manage content, and large articles like the <a href="articles.cfm?inc=cf_cfscript.cfm"><span class="caps">CFSCRIPT</span></a> article just posted. Its not like a blog entry that consists of a few paragaphs. It has code listings, author notes, headings. It&#8217;s a document, and up until now I&#8217;ve done no document management on my site. I&#8217;ll figure something out, but in the meantime I have bigger fish to fry.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So America is probably the last country making primary use of something other than the metric system. From my scant knowledge of the subject, I seem to recall that a foot as we know it was the length of a British King&#8217;s foot (you&#8217;d think that with my British heritage I&#8217;d know/care more about British history).</p>
<p>In 1962, the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/fun/smoots.html">Smoot</a> <p>was invented at <span class="caps">MIT</span>. Now, when I hear <span class="caps">MIT</span> I think cutting edge, precise, creative science and scientific discovery at it&#8217;s best. In 1962, a bunch of the geeks that were supposed to help build the brand of <span class="caps">MIT</span> helped perpetuate obscure measurement systems by coming up with the Smoot (which is really 5&#8217; 7&quot;, or 170.16984000000002 centimeters). The Smoot is used to measure the amount of Smoots on a particularly long bridge (365 Smoots plus an ear in total). Shame on these geeks for not promoting the simple metric system. Shame indeed.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly thirty minutes after posting my last entry, my manager cruised by my cube and said &#8220;Hey Mike, you gotta minute?&#8221; as he&nbsp;headed for the conference room. &#8220;Not normal&#8221; I thought to myself. It looked like a big meeting. Once through the doors, I sensed a lot of discomfort. This didn&#8217;t look like it was going to be a good meeting. I made my way to the couch, the only couch, and the most comfortable seat in the room. If I was going to have an uncomfortable meeting, my cheeks might as well have some comfort.</p>
<p>A lot of time was spent with several blank faced managers from several departments sitting across from the growing croud of employees from different departments. It seemed that one person was missing, and that it was vitally important that this person be here before the meeting started. This wasn&#8217;t normal either. Usually we just say &#8220;sucks to be him, he&#8217;s gonna be late&#8221; and get on with it. Today was different.</p>
<p>Three possibilities ran through my mind. Either we were all going to get a firm talking to for something we did or didn&#8217;t do, or we were all going to be shifted into a new department (all 50 or so of us?) or we were all going to get fired. The last possibility seemed unreasonable, we just had a pep rally about how we were profitable last quarter. We were the top site on the net, our share prices were stable.</p>
<p>Mystery man arrived, and one of the managers started to speak. &#8220;This meeting is what you fear.&#8221; I mostly fear losing my teeth, world destruction, choking on grapes,&nbsp;or universe implosion. None of that seemed to be happening in this meeting, so I felt pretty good about myself. Except when the next sentenced arrived. &#8220;We have to make cutbacks, and this affects those of you in this room.&#8221; Nuts. I was in the room. I&#8217;d only worked there a few months. My wife is pregnant. I have a mortgage to pay. I never cashed in on the Internet craze. I had just told my wife that I&#8217;d be working there for at least several years.</p>
<p>So, now I&#8217;m unemployed, again. This time however there&#8217;s no fat royalty check easing the pain. Things are going to get difficult in Buffington land.</p>
