  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyday at about this time I begin to notice how comfortable my feet are. There&#8217;s some kind of fine balance between the age of my shoes, the socks I&#8217;m wearing, and my routine that gives me comfortable feet. What a precious gift!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve met me in person you probably know I&#8217;m usually carrying a big honkin&#8217; camera around. It&#8217;s my beloved Nikon D100, and it did set me back a bit, but as I learn how to take full advantage of the camera the price tag seems more and more worth it. I&#8217;ve had it since February of this year, and have learned a lot about it that I felt was worth sharing.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good things about this camera, but despite that, I have a few complaints, which is what I&#8217;ll focus on for now. Although, as you&#8217;ll see, they&#8217;re not show stoppers by any means.</p>
<p><strong>Flashes<br /></strong><p>If you want to have a flash that integrates well with the camera&#8217;s automatic exposure meters, aperatures or shutter speed or both, you basically only have two choices. The <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&amp;grp=4&amp;productNr=4717NAS" target="">SB80DX</a> flash or the <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&amp;grp=4&amp;productNr=4716NCP" target="">SB50DX</a>. I think there is a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&amp;grp=4&amp;productNr=4708NCP" target="">smaller flash</a> that is also compatible, but it&#8217;s no better than the on-camera flash. The problem with these flashes, aside from the limited choice, is that they&#8217;re freaking expensive. The SB80DX is at least $330.00, and the SB50DX isn&#8217;t far from that.</p><br />
<p>So what do you get with the SB80DX? Well, fortunately a lot. It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful flash, and when connected to the camera makes you feel like a flashing fool. Multiple flashes in a single exposure,&nbsp;super fast recycle rate, and fully articulated flash head for bounce flash.&nbsp;It integrates so well with the camera that in automatic mode, you don&#8217;t have to do anything. It knows how to light the shot based on light readings, knows the distance of the subject by flashing a red autofocus grid, and knows the focal length of your lens (which helps it adjust where the flash bulb sits in relation to the flash lens).</p><br />
<p>So what don&#8217;t you get? Perhaps it&#8217;s my own pet peeve, but I&#8217;d think a flash like this should be able to work remotely in something other than just manual mode. I can set up the flash in manual mode, set on it on ledge somewhere, and use my on-camera flash to trigger the remote SB80DX, but I can only do so with both the SB80DX set up in manual mode and my on-camera flash as well. This means I have plan my shot in advance, or get lucky. I don&#8217;t mind either alternative, but sometimes you don&#8217;t want to have to rely on either. I don&#8217;t have the advantage of seeing a new potentially different shot, and taking it, and knowing it will turn out.</p><br />
<p>The reason it has to be in full manual mode for both flashes&nbsp;is a digital camera thing. Most digital cameras, whether they&#8217;re <span class="caps">SLR</span> or point and shoot, send out a few pulses of pre-flash before the full flash fires. This is so that the camera can determine what kind of light it can expect to get back, and so that it can setup the <span class="caps">CCD</span> accordingly. These pulses are done so quickly that they&#8217;re impossible to detect with the human eye, but very possible for a slave flash to detect and fire too early. On the D100, the only way to disable the pre-flash is to put the flash into full manual mode. Bummer.</p><br />
<p>But, I&#8217;m not too upset. I have a plan. Instead of using my SB80DX as a slave&nbsp;flash (which is prone to <a href="http://www.skateboardphotography.com/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=printpage&amp;artid=6" target="">getting hit by skateboards</a>) I&#8217;ll hook it up to a cord, and use it as a primary <a href="http://www.skateboardphotography.com/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=printpage&amp;artid=2" target="">flash in my left hand while I shoot with my right</a>, and have it drive other slave flashes. I can go fully automatic, and get slave flashes that ignore the pre-flash. The best of both worlds. A lot of these dedicated slave flashes are small, cheap and rugged.</p><br />
<p><strong>Dusty Chip<br /></strong>When I first saw little black spots on some of my shots I about wanted to die. I couldn&#8217;t believe that such an expensive camera that could take such good shots could also ruin the shots just as easily with dust. The problem with any digital <span class="caps">SLR</span> is that the chip that is used in place of film is very prone to getting dust on it. Because it&#8217;s not sealed, the body of any <span class="caps">SLR</span> camera, film or digital, is at constant risk of getting dust in it whenever a lens is changed. There are ways to minimize dust getting into the camera, but like it or not, dust will get into the camera. Film cameras are less prone to dust showing up in the shot because the plane that light lands on is advanced with each shot, taking dust with it. Also, I&#8217;ve heard that CCDs can actually attract dust because they create a sort of static cling. I haven&#8217;t tested this idea, but wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.</p><br />
<p>Last night I cleaned my <span class="caps">CCD</span> for the first time. Nikon suggests using a blower to blow dust away from the <span class="caps">CCD</span>. This does absolutely no good, because the dust is still in the body of the camera, and if anything, it simply moves. It would be nearly impossible to get the dust out of the body by blowing into the body. For persistent dust, Nikon suggests sending the camera to Nikon for cleaning.</p><br />
<p>I followed a <a href="http://www.pbase.com/copperhill/ccd_cleaning" target=""><span class="caps">CCD</span> cleaning tutorial</a> for using your own supplies to clean the <span class="caps">CCD</span>, and while I was a bit freaked out about the idea at first, after having done it, I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased. My <span class="caps">CCD</span> is clean, and if you take my practice runs out of it, took only about twenty minutes, including prep time. The actual cleaning process took less than a minute.</p><br />
<p>To minimize dust, before changing lenses, I take a lens cloth and do a quick wipe down of where the lens meets the body. It&#8217;s easy to do, especially when you&#8217;re in the habit of keeping the cloth handy. My lens cloth doubles as a grey card, something I use to adjust my camera&#8217;s white balance, so I keep it around.</p><br />
<p>When changing the lens, I keep the camera facing down. Might be futile, but makes me feel good.</p><br />
<p>From now on, I will probably make sure that I do a <span class="caps">CCD</span> cleaning about every other week as part of a camera cleaning routine.</p><br />
<p><strong>Focal Length<br /></strong>Most people will tell you that a digital <span class="caps">SLR</span> has a 1.5x multiplier for the focal length of lenses. This basically means that a normal 35mm lens will actually be a 52.5mm lens. A 35mm lens on a&nbsp;film <span class="caps">SLR</span>&nbsp;basically captures what a human eye sees (except that it can&#8217;t match the human eye&#8217;s peripheral vision). There is no distortion, no &#8220;flattening&#8221;. On a digital <span class="caps">SLR</span>, people will say that it becomes a telephoto.</p><br />
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t entirely true. What is true is that the <span class="caps">CCD</span> on a digital <span class="caps">SLR</span> is smaller than a pane of film, so the image that is captured on the <span class="caps">CCD</span> is cropped by a certain amount. This means that only the middle portion of the light captured by a 35mm lens is used, which makes it seem as if a 35mm lens is actually a 52.5mm. It&#8217;s almost a moot point, except that everything else about the lens is the same &#8211; the aperature, the focusing&nbsp;speed and&nbsp;the sharpness.</p><br />
<p>But, this focal length multiplier motivates people like me to buy wider lenses, so that I can take shots that more accurately capture what my eyes see. The wider the lens, the higher the cost.</p><br />
<p>The workaround is to simply buy a wider lens, or, move further away from the subject. I have a 15-30mm lens, that is basically equivelant to a 22.5-45mm lens &#8211; a more normal range of focal lengths on my <span class="caps">DSLR</span> than it would be on a film <span class="caps">SLR</span>. I want a fisheye, but need to wait for a much wider fisheye than&nbsp;normal, and one&nbsp;than what can be found at reasonable prices.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I was strolling about my digital empire, and became a bit alarmed about&nbsp;how many backups of backups I had. I started unfolding a few archives, and kept finding websites or applications I&#8217;d written that existed only in that one backup. And then, the methods of backing up were all done differently. I have reason to be concerned.</p>
<p>In the current state of things, it&#8217;s going to be difficult to reconcile everything into a single concise heirarchy. It can be done, but it will take time, and planning. I&#8217;ve done it before with over 10,000 photographs, and could do it again, but don&#8217;t relish the thought.</p>
<p>But more forboding is, once I&#8217;ve consilidated all my creative works and placed them in a central and core location, how do I make sure I don&#8217;t branch things off into different places in the future?</p>
<p>I think that maybe I need to be taught how to be a good backer-upper. Or I need simple software that handles it all for me. I envision a tool that I install on all my machines, whether they&#8217;re Linux based, OS X, or Windows, that looks at folders I want saved, and watches for my changes. When the state of the folder changes, it automatically reflects those changes on my &#8220;backup server&#8221;. It would need to be able to rollback too, in case the change was something nasty (like a file mistakenly deleted). Now, I know there are tools for this (maybe a Linux based fileserver with a journalling file system and some type of sync tool) but I want simple. Read: easy.</p>
<p>Maybe something already exists, but until it does, I&#8217;m going to have to do it the hard way which, as far as I can tell, is pretty much the only way at this point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was eighteen I suffered from something that a lot of eighteen year old young men suffer from: utter stupidity. I&#8217;m going to tell a long story about a very rich experience I had as a result of my extreme stupidity. I regret that I have to leave stuff out to make it less than a novel, but hopefully I&#8217;ll leave in&nbsp;just enough.</p>
<p>I had a sweet gasoline scented 1972 Pea Green Datsun 510 when I was eighteen, and because it was falling apart most of the time, I&#8217;d get fix-it tickets. Police would pull me over because the registration was expired, or because I had no front bumper, or because of a broken tail light. In any case, one of the things eighteen year old young men do when they suffer from utter stupidity is neglect things. In my case, I neglected to fix something to the point where an arrest warrant was issued. I became a wanted man.</p>
<p>On a Thursday night, before driving home from Carrie&#8217;s house, she said &#8220;Mike, you be careful, don&#8217;t get pulled over.&#8221; I was literally 200 feet away from my driveway when I got pulled over. I was arrested, my car was impounded, and I was on my way to the Huntington Beach City Jail. On the way to jail, the police officer decided to go on a car chase. We were doing 120 mph on straight-aways, and sliding around corners at over 50 mph. I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled. He was polite, and asked &#8220;Would you mind hanging out for a bit, we can still get some work done with you in the back?&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t be more agreeable.</p>
<p>At <span class="caps">HBCJ</span>, I was put in a cell with a white dude that looked like a full on criminal. Neck tattoos, gang tattoos on his hands and arms, the baggy clothing, bald head, scars, missing teeth, gold teeth, the complete uniform. He was pretty imposing. He was there for possesion of marijuana, and liked to call me &#8220;Dawg&#8221;. Almost every other word out of his mouth was something like &#8220;You know Dawg?&#8221; or &#8220;Dawg, I ain&#8217;t going down like dis&#8221; or &#8220;Dawg, why you in here?&#8221;. He turned out to not be so bad. We spent the night in a cell where, on the twenty foot tall ceiling was the name of a guy I went to highschool with etched in the concrete. I spent most of the night not sleeping, but trying to figure out how Mark was able to etch &#8220;Mark Lee&#8221; on the ceiling in letters two feet tall. I decided he had to either do it with a zipper, or pulled out one of his teeth to do it, then convinced other cell mates to hoist him up while they stood on the upper bunk.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was strip searched. I had to prove I wasn&#8217;t hiding anything in any orifices, which meant getting naked and presenting my backside to an officer with gloves. Not pleasant. Few things in my life have been more unpleasant, although I&#8217;ll get to&nbsp;several&nbsp;of those as I continue. I was allowed to get back in my street clothes, and then was hand cuffed to my cell mate. My right arm to his left. We shuffled onto a bus, and shipped up to the Westminster Courthouse where we would see a judge and make a plea.</p>
<p>Being cuffed to another man was interesting. It was a lot like that I Love Lucy episode where Ricky and Lucy were handcuffed for reasons I&#8217;ve forgot. They have to do all sorts of creative things in order to do the most mundane tasks, like scratch thier face. I had to relax my arm when my cell mate had an itch, and he had to do the same for me. We shared some interesting time with eachother, and in total, spent about&nbsp;fours hours cuffed together. In those four hours we learned alot about eachother, and once in the bigger jail system, I considered him an ally and a friend.</p>
<p>When we got to Westminster, we were put in a gigantic holding cell with about thirty other inmates. Everyone in there was waiting to see a judge to make a plea. There were murderers in that room. Huge career criminals who would do pushups to pass the time. Some would preach, some would rap, some would proclaim their innocence, some were coming down off of heroin. In the middle of the room was a single steel&nbsp;toilet. No walls, no privacy, no toilet paper (it had been stolen by the earliest arrivals to be used as a pillow). If you used this toilet, you were the focal point of the room. In my twelve hours in that cell, a single person used the toilet. He was about 6&#8217; 10&quot;, could probably rip the toilet of it&#8217;s concrete mount and reposition it in your head. He was a scary individual. More imposing was the fact that he spent about thirty minutes doing his deed, and didn&#8217;t seem to care in the slightest that he was the focal point. He also produced an equally imposing odor. When finished, he yelled &#8220;Hey you little Chinese [f&#8217;er], give me that [f&#8217;ing] roll of toilet paper before I crush your skull in&#8221;. He had a roll of toilet paper in exactly 0.02 nanoseconds.</p>
<p>I met a smiling guy in this holding cell named T-Bone. He was about 4&#8217; 9&quot;, and had shot a man while robbing a liquour store. We talked in the morning for a bit, and he was saying he was glad to be going back to prison. He didn&#8217;t seem like a bad guy, he was pretty friendly and was very social. He felt he couldn&#8217;t get by in real life without messing up and that he knew the rules of prison. After our conversation he said &#8220;When they bring by our lunch, you&#8217;re going to give me yours because I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221; Well, I was too, and when lunch came, I gobbled mine up. When he came back around he said &#8220;Where&#8217;s my lunch?&#8221; and I said &#8220;I ate it.&#8221;, knowing full well he might go nuts on me. Instead, he smiled and said &#8220;You&#8217;re a crazy [f&#8217;er] you know that?&#8221; and gave me a fake punch to the arm, leaving to harass others.</p>
<p>T-Bone got called to make his plea, and ended up making a plea bargain of guilty in exchange for ten years in state prison. He was not so happy when he came back. He ended up sulking in a corner, head in his hands until he was moved into another cell.</p>
<p>I was called to make a plea. The guard came to the edge of the cell, called my name, and handcuffed me through a hole in the barred wall. He then lead me, along with about four other prisoners who were chained to me, up some dark, long and narrow hallways. We were led right into a courtroom, chained as we were, and there were tons of people in there. Some of the people cried when they saw my chainmates. I didn&#8217;t see anyone I knew. I wasn&#8217;t in the room for more than a few seconds when the judge boomed &#8220;Michael Buffington, how do you plea&#8221; over a microphone. From our cage, I couldn&#8217;t even see where&nbsp;he was sitting.&nbsp;I wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond and&nbsp;my mind began racing, &#8220;guilty of what?&#8221; I thought. I wasn&#8217;t even certain of the charges, I was that stupid. I said &#8220;Uhh&#8221; after a long pause, and the judge boomed back &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you Monday morning Mr. Buffington when you&#8217;ve made up your mind.&#8221; My chain mates entered their pleas &#8211; all guilty. We were led back to our cell, where it all really began to hit me. </p>
<p>I was going to be in jail at least all weekend. I had absolutely no freedom, and I was becoming accutely aware of it. And I had to piss.&nbsp;I hadn&#8217;t gone since I&#8217;d been arrested, and it was now mid afternoon. It was getting really painful, and I was too chicken to do it in the middle of the room. As the day went on, the mood in the room changed. People all around me were beginning to realize their fates too. The chatter among us stopped nearly entirely. There was a lot introspection going on.</p>
<p>I was cuffed to my original cuff mate again, either by design or by luck. He had the left side this time. We were put on a bus going to Orange County Jail. Getting on the bus, we passed a section of seats that were barred off from the rest of the seats. The men in these seats were whistling and making lewd comments as we got on. Stuff I don&#8217;t like to repeat, let alone remember. I found out later on as these guys broke out singing along to an oldies song,&nbsp;&#8220;Sugar Shack&#8221;, that these were rapists, sex offenders, mass murderers, child molestors, pedophiles. They weren&#8217;t barred for our safety, they were barred for their own safety. I can&#8217;t hear that song again now without getting some serious creepy feelings.</p>
<p>Orange County Jail is a blur, with only some key memories. They moved you from concrete and glass cell to cell every few hours for reasons I never have determined. In one cell, I was alone with an <span class="caps">LSD</span> dealer. He&#8217;d run from police with his sheets of paper, and had stuffed them in his sock so he could run faster. He absorbed a ton of <span class="caps">LSD</span>, and I spent three or four hours alone in cell with him while he tripped out. He screamed at all the snails in the cell, and claimed that they were forming a bigger snail, and that I should help him smash it. In less paranoid states, he&#8217;d pull his sock down, and point at where the papers had been, and say things like &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s a window, can you see how wonderful it is? Can you see the children?&#8221;. He laughed as more and more &#8220;tentacles&#8221; grew from me, and got scared when some of them &#8220;went for him&#8221; and he had to grab them and fight them off. I worried most of the time that he&#8217;d incorporate me into one of his more paranoid hallucenations, and harm me.</p>
<p>In another cell, a bigger one, there was a free&nbsp;local calls pay phone with about ten guys waiting for it. No one knew I was in jail yet, so I too started waiting for it. The same guy who wasn&#8217;t afraid of pooping in front of everyone was right in front of me, and spent a good hour preaching to me while doing pushups, waiting for the phone. When he finally did get to the phone, he ended up in a shouting match with what I assume was his wife or girlfriend. In a fit of rage, he smashed the handset of the phone against the box, then proceeded to tear that box off the wall. After over an hour of waiting, I made no fuss whatsoever, and sat down as if nothing had happened.&nbsp;He managed to get it off the wall, and threw it against the ground a few times. Gaurds came in pretty quickly, and escorted him out without incident.</p>
<p>I ended up in a cell by myself, and after nearly three days without pissing, I stood above a toilet to do the job, but nothing happened. Tried as I might, I couldn&#8217;t go. I stood for twenty minutes before even a trickle, and then it probably took an hour before I was done. I&#8217;ve learned since that the bladder doesn&#8217;t work if it&#8217;s too stretched out. It loses it&#8217;s ability to squeeze out the liquid if it&#8217;s stretched beyond it&#8217;s limits.</p>
<p>We were forced to take a shower. I showered in a stall that was watched over by prisoners working as guards. They stood behind a glass wall as I took a cold, completely naked, shower in a room with twenty other showering men. They whistled as each new guy got into the shower, and yelled out things like &#8220;He&#8217;s got a woman&#8217;s ass&#8221; or &#8220;Bend over cutie&#8221;. It was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life.</p>
<p>It felt good though, afterwards to be in a clean jumpsuit and slippers. I slept for the first time in a few days on a flat concrete floor with no pillow. At one point, my throat was really itchy from a cold I was fighting, and as I&#8217;d start to fall asleep it would itch, and I&#8217;d make a little noise, like an &#8220;uhh&#8221; noise. And it would wake me up, and I&#8217;d realize how insane it was to do that, and try to cover it with a cough. No one else seemed to care, almost everyone was asleep.</p>
<p>It was rumoured that the next cell had beds, which I was looking forward to. But before I got there, I was called out by a guard. He took me into the hall and said &#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221; I told him why I was there, officially, but he asked again and said &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me the charge, what the hell are you doing here?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I messed up. I let something slide that I should have taken care of.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, now get the hell out of here, don&#8217;t come back, you don&#8217;t belong.&#8221; He opened a door to another cell. There was a window into the cell and a counter top, a little old lady behind it without smiling, staring at me. I walked up to her, and she said &#8220;Strip. Here are&nbsp;your clothes, you&#8217;re being discharged.&#8221; Behind her, through another window, I could see my dad, his hands in his pockets, waiting patiently, not knowing that I could see him. I was relieved. After four days, I was allowed to leave, and I knew my dad enough to know that he wouldn&#8217;t have to say a word. We drove home in silence.</p>
<p>Jail is a horrible, horrible place, and I was in it for only four days, in one of the nicest jails in this country. I will never go there again, and after my experience there, I&#8217;ve been far more responsible. But when I tell this story, the guys I tell it to will almost always agree that they did something equally stupid when they were my age, and the girls agree that they knew people, men mostly, who did equally stupid things. Perhaps as youth we don&#8217;t realize the possible real world consequences of something&nbsp;unless they hit us right in the face, and maybe sometimes we need to be hit hard enough to have it sting forever, so we never make the mistake again.</p>
<p>Despite the horrible experience,&nbsp;I learned alot about myself, and about people in general, and about being responsible, and about making sure you don&#8217;t let other people down. For me, jail was beneficial &#8211; I got a hard and fast lesson about life, and I behave differently because of it today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The temptation, up until now, to perform Snapple bottle acrobatics has been hard to resist. As great risk can bring great reward, so can it bring great disaster as well. Usually I fight the urge to get up and walk the huge distance to the cafe to get a Snapple. So when I do get the bottle, it&#8217;s after a lot of internal debate, and physical activity. Then, on the way back to my desk, I simply cannot help but flip the Snapple bottle. I toss the bottle, and perform slow, graceful flips. Or I do a tight double flip. I marvel at my talents of flipping the Snapple bottle, and revel in how perfect a flipping implement it is. The latest trick has been to flip the bottle without losing contact with the bottle. Let it glide around my fingers on it&#8217;s axis. Stun people as I take great risk of breaking my precious bottle of nectar to perform unnecessary stunts. I imagine that they say to themselves &quot;Check that out. Look how casual he is. He&#8217;s <i>flipping</i> <p>his bottle of Snapple like it&#8217;s a stick of useless wood. He&#8217;s a rule breaker. He has guts.&quot;</p><br />
<p>Until the bottle smashes to the floor in front of the T1 training room, in the busiest hall on campus, where hundreds, or even thousands of my coworkers walk every day. Glass everywhere, me groveling, expending futile effort, picking up infinite shards of glass in a puddle of Raspberry Iced Tea. Men in tool belts discover it within seconds, and scramble to get orange cones. They&#8217;re not happy, and as much as they&#8217;d like me to clean it up as punishment, they insist I don&#8217;t touch it. Probably some contractual thing.</p><br />
<p>And now I sit, without the Snapple that I labored for. After the internal debates, the walking, the freewheeling flipping spirit, I&#8217;m short $1.10 and my dignity. I can never flip a Snapple bottle again.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s when&nbsp;I have the most ideas that I&#8217;m the least productive. What a curse. I&#8217;m going to finish a project, then become single focused, or else I will continue to flail about in my constant forays. Before I make this &#8220;singly focused&#8221; attempt, I have to get some things out in the open.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking heavily lately about the social dynamics of the Internet, both in it&#8217;s current state and in the past. I realize I have little but intuition and previous experience to guide me, I&#8217;m no researcher.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve come to a single conclusion: the Internet isn&#8217;t much of anything, and for the most part is a big waste. The equipment, the investment, the wires, the constant progress, the hype, the constant consumption and desire for new information. The total crap to good stuff ratio is so in favor of total crap. It&#8217;s still very rare to see truly good and innovative stuff. I&#8217;m tired of that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to get really interested in skateboarding photography. I&#8217;ve been thumbing through my mags and I can usually figure out how and why the composed the shot they did, how many flashes, if any, they used, what kind of lens, and even aperatures and shutter speeds. Which isn&#8217;t to say I&#8217;d be any good at it, but I think with some practice I could get some shots into a skateboarding mag. I know enough about my gear, composition, and skateboarding to make photographs with some impact. At least that&#8217;s what I tell myself now.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for a house. Being so transitory for the past two or four years has stoked the embers of a desire for stability into a raging inferno. We&#8217;re not anti-travel now, we just want a home base. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to having a new home office, hopefully one where I can pursue some serious pursuits effectively. For me, I need an unchanging environment. If I leave the office, and come back two hours later, the computer needs to be in the same state, the papers on the desk, the mouse, the temperature. I&#8217;m hoping to do that, which means I&#8217;ll need to make sure Carrie has an effective space as well. I need a good chair, and no wires visible at all. I need massive speakers, plenty of music, and stylish, yet effective CD/<span class="caps">DVD</span> storage. I don&#8217;t need a good view, in fact, good views slow me down. I&#8217;m highly prone to distraction, to the point where I get distracted from whatever is distracting me.</p>
<p>A yard is good too. I want to grow watermelons. And I want a mini halfpipe. And a work shop so I can maybe weld things, or make art, or squeeze things in a bench mounted vise. A hose for water fights. Private fences so I can dig trenches without having to wear pants. I want to be able to sustain my home with income solely from the Internet, from work that I&#8217;ve done once, so that I can spend time with my family, and make mud pies on a Tuesday at 11am.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I had a meeting in downtown Portland, which went well. What didn&#8217;t go so well was the fact that someone took my truck while I was in the meeting. At first I thought maybe I&#8217;d misplaced it. I&#8217;d parked at a meter, maxed out the time on it, and had expected to find it as I&#8217;d left it. I thought that maybe I&#8217;d walked up the wrong street, so I backtracked to my meeting point, and tried again. Same results. I did this a few times until I accepted the fact that it was either stolen or towed. I went to the spot I was pretty sure it was parked, found no glass or evidence of thievery, and decided that it must have been towed.</p>
<p>I found a phone number for monthly parking passes, called it with my mobile, and got the number for Portland Auto Records. <span class="caps">PAR</span> told me that I needed to know the <span class="caps">VIN</span> number. In no way would they allow me to describe the vehicle, the <span class="caps">VIN</span> number was the key, and no sweet talking would get them to budge without it.</p>
<p>I called home ten times. No answer all ten times. I called an eleventh time for good measure. No answer. It occurred to me that because we&#8217;d been in California up until midnight the night before, that our cordless phone was probably out of juice, which would mean it wouldn&#8217;t ring. We usually also turn off the base&#8217;s ringer because of it&#8217;s bone grinding intensity.</p>
<p>I called the <span class="caps">DMV</span>. They told me to call Sacremento where my car is still registered. I&#8217;d been on hold for thirty minutes to get that advice. They suggested I might be on hold for an hour with Sacremento. I called my apartment complex, who I thought had my <span class="caps">VIN</span> on file from my rental application. They didn&#8217;t have it. I called my insurance company. They had it. They gave it to me. It took an awkward five minutes to jot down the number in my phone, as the girl read off two digits at a time, waiting for my confirmation each time. Then we did that again, to double check the digits.</p>
<p>I called <span class="caps">PAR</span> again, told them I had the <span class="caps">VIN</span>, looked down at my phone to begin reading it off when the battery died. It died, right when I was almost there.&nbsp;I was stranded in a bustling city, in fancy-for-me&nbsp;clothing, with nothing but an <span class="caps">ATM</span> card. No real shelter, no communications, no pen, no paper, nothing. It became very clear how much I rely on my phone. My phone became a huge single point of failure. Total failure. It was true to me for the two hours it took to gather the single most important piece of information I needed, then failed at the most crucial point.</p>
<p>I had a slice of pizza, and sat to think.</p>
<p>I found a T-Mobile store and convinced them to charge my phone. They also suggested I exchange the phone, just in case the battery in my Sidekick was wonky. The whole time my phone charged I pulled phone numbers and the <span class="caps">VIN</span> off it onto a piece of paper. Once that was done, I went to a payphone, called <span class="caps">PAR</span> and read them off my <span class="caps">VIN</span> number.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like way too many digits, what&#8217;s the make and model?&#8221;</p>
<p>The second time I called, all it took for me to find out where my truck was was&nbsp;to say &#8220;Toyota Tacoma,&nbsp;four door, California plates&#8221; and they told me exactly where it was. No arguments. The first person I&#8217;d called was just being an ass, and deserves a job at the <span class="caps">DMV</span> where people can scowl at her in person, not just over the phone.</p>
<p>I called for a taxi, and spent $10.00 going about ten blocks. I spent $105 getting my truck out of the tow yard. I spent twenty minutes being puzzled over the citation that the city put on my car, the reason it was towed. It said &#8220;Parked about 20&#8221; from the curve&quot;. No fine specified, no spelling skills, no truth. I think I was singled out for having a bigger vehicle on a crowded street with California plates. My meeting was at 11:00am, and I didn&#8217;t get home until 4:30.</p>
<p>Having had this happen, I&#8217;m completely amped on coming up with a way to have all my most important information on a piece of paper in my wallet, without compromising my security. I can&#8217;t rely on a cell phone to do it for me, or my own memory that&#8217;s for sure. I need a better way, and I&#8217;ve yet to find it. I&#8217;m thinking a simple encryption that I could do in my head would work well. Letter shifting or something, something that wouldn&#8217;t require a calculator to figure out, but something that required you know a key to unlock the code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s no excuse for my latest absence of entries. But I will say this:</p>
<p><a href="http://mx.blogs.com/photos/england2/" target=""></a></p>
<p>Photos of England</p>
<p>Also, I was thinking about how cool TiVo is, but only if you have a lot of channels to unleash it on. Currently I have about 5 channels that aren&#8217;t home shopping network channels. This really seems to limit TiVo. But it is impressive to know that I can say without a doubt that my TiVo is getting the best shows possible, given its choices.</p>
<p>I saw a commercial on TV the other day. Some bar of soap that was called a &#8220;bath bar&#8221; instead of saying it was some weird combination of fat and lye or whatever soap is made of. The female&nbsp;voiceover was speaking in a smooth, soothing voice about how this bar had secret ingredients to make your skin the softest possible. Then it spilled the beans, and came right&nbsp;out and said &#8220;And that secret ingredient is Shea Butter&#8221;. What the hell? If it&#8217;s so secret, why tell me what it is not two seconds after working me up into this &#8220;Oooo, a secret&#8221; frenzy? And what on earth is Shea Butter?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been reading while I walk to work. I point myself in the direction of work, and before I know it, I&#8217;m there, unharmed. Somehow I manage to get&nbsp; so completely absorbed in reading&nbsp;that I don&#8217;t&nbsp;even remember my &#8220;commute&#8221;. It&#8217;s faboo-luss.</p>
<p>Finally, once again, I need a haircut. I had a good haircut in England a while ago, and I&#8217;m so opposed to change that I&#8217;m now resisting getting it done. But I must! Today I will do it after work. No matter how bad my hair looks when it&#8217;s freshly cut, it always looks worse when it&#8217;s covering my eyes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I watched Bowling for Columbine last night, and I think both of us had a very different reaction to the movie than we&#8217;d thought we would have.</p>
<p>Before watching the documentary, I had assumed that what I would see was a lot of massaged interviews where Michael Moore would manipulate the footage afterwards to better suit his view. I assumed that it would be far too liberal for my blood, and that I&#8217;d end up thinking it a huge liberal agenda propaganda piece. I had seen a lot of buzz and controversy over the documentary, suggesting that his facts weren&#8217;t actually facts, and that he&#8217;d made a lot of stuff up.</p>
<p>I came away with a far different reaction. I find myself now asking what I think was Michael&#8217;s main question and subject of the documentary. Why does America have so much violent gun related crime? It&#8217;s not answered of course &#8211; no one can be certain why, but he does go down a few explorations of why.</p>
<p>One of the ideas he had was that we are a nation pumped full of fear by the media. That idea struck me squarely because I&#8217;ve been reeling, and quite literally getting sick to my stomach over American television. Before moving to Oregon, I watched local evening news in Southern California pretty regularly. Not religiously, but enough to become used to it. Multiple murders and gang slayings and such were the norm. It was abnormal (I now shudder to think) if there wasn&#8217;t some kind of gruesome and violent murder, car chase, or rapist.</p>
<p>When we moved to Oregon, we were surprised by the news. It was only every other night or so where you&#8217;d hear about anything even close to Southern California crime. A shooting in Gresham, no one hurt, a car chase that happened in the middle of the night up the I-5, etc. Violent crime was less, according to the news.</p>
<p>In the UK, there&#8217;s no such thing as far as I know as our version of local metropolitan city evening news. There are nationwide news shows run by both the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and cable and satellite providers, but nothing of a similar nature to the 3 or 4 major networks each running an &#8220;Evening News&#8221; show at the same time nightly.</p>
<p>And the content the UK news shows broadcast usually covers things like politics, hedgehogs, science, history, weather, world news, fox hunting, and the occasional missing kid. In 4 months, watching perhaps a few times a week, the evening news didn&#8217;t once tell me of a violent gun crime, and only once talked about a crime where a teen in East London stabbed another teen with a three inch blade.</p>
<p>Coming back to Oregon from the UK, we turned on the evening news and were stunned. Crime had gone up it seemed in Oregon. We were hearing about murderers, rapists, thieves, child molesters, and more, in one night. Except that it was the same level of despair &#8211; our sensitivity to it had increased due to its absence.</p>
<p>After watching Bowling for Columbine, and hearing the quote &#8220;we are a nation pumped full of fear. As long as we are in a state of fear, we consume. Fear drives consumption.&#8221;*, I believe I understand. Portland is just as safe as its always been, and South Central LA is not as dangerous as it&#8217;s made out to be. It seems crystal clear to me that fear drives consumption. Remember all the money spent on Y2K (fear of Armageddon), On dot coms (fear of missing out), on gas masks, duct tape and plastic, bomb shelters (fear of terrorists), on Cold War programs, nuclear weapons, fighter jets, bombers, laser armed satellites, intelligence gathering (fear of attack)?</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m not crystal clear on, however, is a that there&#8217;s some kind of huge government conspiracy to promote fear, or that the media is out to promote fear. Fear drives ratings, and ratings get advertising dollars. If stories about puppies and parakeets got big ratings, the news would show just as many breaking news stories about them as they now do about kids killing kids. Oprah seems to be the only person in the media today who can make money off of shows about charity and doing good for others, but even she sinks to selling fear from time to time. Governments need an excuse to stay big, and to collect taxes, and benefit from a society in fear. A society willing to put an incredibly disproportionate amount of money towards attacking other countries than they are towards educating their own children must be scared of something.</p>
<p>I appreciate Michael Moore bringing up the question of why America has so much violent gun crime. I&#8217;m glad he didn&#8217;t try to say exactly what we should do &#8211; it&#8217;s too hard a question to answer, and I think it&#8217;s beneficial to let people come up with an answer on their own. What is clear despite anything bad that can be said about the documentary is that we are a nation of mass consumption, and that consumption has massive consequences on our children and other human beings in this world. </p>
<p>The fact that Americans use guns to kill each other is a symptom of something broader, and is likely a combination of a lot of things. Perhaps it&#8217;s a combination of mass consumption, selfishness, lack of personal responsibility, lack of goal setting, lack of a feeling of worth, or lack of focusing on the worth of other individuals. Whatever it is, it&#8217;s growing like a cancer, and we&#8217;ll likely not see a regression any time soon.</p>
<p>* This isn&#8217;t an exact quote, but the words and meaning are generally the same. The person who said it: Marilyn Manson, after having been blamed for the shootings at Columbine. He also brought up another point, saying to the effect &#8220;the day of the Columbine Shootings President Clinton dropped more bombs in the Kosovo conflict than had been dropped during the entire campaign. He&#8217;s directly responsible for killing people &#8211; I&#8217;ve simply expressed my opinion through my music. I&#8217;d like to think I have more influence over the world than The President of the United States, but I probably don&#8217;t &#8211; why is he not being held just as responsible?&#8221;</p>
