  <div class="entry-content"><p>An official report of our trip to Paris with some photos is coming soon, but first, I have to vent so bad its nearly life threatening if I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Carrie and I bought a backpack to carry Leah in. Once the shock of subjecting our bodies to an extra thirty pounds had subsided, we found that it&#8217;s an absolutely fantastic way to travel with a baby. Leah loves sitting in the backpack, and our mobility has increased by huge margins. We can zip in and out of Underground stations and dart through crowds, fully avoiding any of the hassles having a baby laden stroller produces.</p>
<p>The Louvre doesn&#8217;t seem to agree.</p>
<p>We arrived at the museum, bought our tickets at the self serve kiosks (we didn&#8217;t have to hassle with a stroller in a queue), walked through piles of people beneath the famous glass pyramid, and made our way to the queue for the Denon wing. The ticket taker said something in French which we came to understand meant that no baby backpacks were allowed and that they had free strollers available. We took that blow on the chin, got ourselves a stroller and quickly realized that hell hath no fury like a stroller in the Louvre. There are an almost infinite amount of stairs at the Louvre. They come in all sorts of random groupings. Sets of four, three, twenty-six, nineteen, you name it, they have it. And it&#8217;s the largest art museum in the world.</p>
<p>To help the lazy, stroller pushing, wheelchair rolling, stair averse people, they&#8217;ve hidden elevators or wheelchair lifts all over the place. The problem is, they&#8217;re nearly impossible to find, and when you do find them, they take ages to operate (or, as we found, don&#8217;t work at all). Or, the power goes out while you&#8217;re on the top floor trying to get to the bottom so you can change a diaper, and you wait in darkness (as we did) while they restore power, only to find that once the power is restored, the elevators don&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure why they&#8217;d be so stupid to turn us away with our lean and sleek solution to child transport. It wasn&#8217;t just a &#8220;no backpacks&#8221; rule, there were dozens of people inside with backpacks. We think they have some ridiculous idea that if a child is in a backpack, they will be more likely to grab at things. They&#8217;re wrong. About the entire thing. There might be some interesting art stored at the Louvre, but because the haven&#8217;t put a split second of thought into child backpacks, they get the &#8220;worst museum ever&#8221; medal from me. I don&#8217;t care if they have artwork made by mutated elephants that spent their childhood on the vast and spacious planes of Neptune, the Louvre still sucks, and will suck until they let people carry their kids in backpacks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m probably echoing what&#8217;s already been said, but it occurs to me that things in the blogosphere aren&#8217;t as they could be.</p>
<p>There are so many weblogs now &#8211; more than I know. You could tell me there are ten thousand and I&#8217;d believe you just as easily as if you told me there are 3 million. I only read about ten, at the most, and itâ€™s because I don&#8217;t want to take the effort to find new ones. There are so many, I don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p>Because I know there is good unknown content out there, I&#8217;ve installed tools like <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/" target="">Newsgator</a> <p>and other &#8220;feed&#8221; based tools to help me discover new content, but rarely do I discover anything, except that the feed doesn&#8217;t work, or I&#8217;m back to the problem of finding new feeds.</p><br />
<p>Something needs to be done. <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/" target="">Anil</a> mentioned something at <a href="http://www.stingykids.net/sxsw/archives/000047.html" target=""><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> that I thought he was saying with a bit of sarcasm at first, but realize now that he was probably being more serious than I assumed (and foreshadowing services like <a href="http://www.typepad.com/" target="">TypePad</a> at the same time).</p><br />
<p>He said something alluding to the fact that we should be able to search 20,000 weblogs at a time. At first it sounded crazy and impractical. Why would I want that much data when perhaps only a small percentage of it would interest me.</p><br />
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the point I think he was trying to make. If I have thousands of blog entries at my finger tips I can do some pretty amazing things. I can make relationships with the entries, I can categorize them, I can search against them, I can find new content very easily. By having thousands of available weblogs I would at least be able to find the small percentage of weblogs I&#8217;m interested in.</p><br />
<p>So basically what I want is a relational database snapshot of the entire blogoshere. I want a data warehouse that I can perform not only statistical analysis on, but make intelligent relationships between blog entries. I want to be able to see trends appear, spot memes as they&#8217;re happening. I want a stock ticker that tells me the common theme for the day.</p><br />
<p>I once set about making this tool. Getting the data wasn&#8217;t difficult. I built some functions to grab <span class="caps">XML</span> based feeds and stored them in a database. But the trials of importing all the different flavors of properly formed <span class="caps">XML</span>, let alone poorly formed <span class="caps">XML</span>, were great. There are far too many formats, and versions of formats, and unknown formats.</p><br />
<p>So I gave up. I now I sit and wait for someone else to make it.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I almost forgot! Actually, I did, completely, but now I&#8217;ve recalled it, so story starts now:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we, being sister, step-dad, and sister&#8217;s boyfriend were in London on our way somewhere by foot. We were standing near an Underground station on the surface getting our bearings when a Mexican guy came up to me and just started speaking full on heavy duty Spanish.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, I speak a little Spanish, and Mexican Spanish at that (I tried speaking the Spanish to actual Spaniards, and they gave me the finger with just their eyes). So I figured out that he was trying to get to Covent Garden or some place like that, and we were speaking brilliant and fluent Spanish for a good 5 minutes when I realized that he actually wanted to know how to get there by bus, not tube. I laughed nervously, thinking he might become enraged when I broke the news that I knew nothing of the bus system, and that he&#8217;d have to figure it out himself.</p>
<p>He laughed happily, putting me at ease, but then, and I joke not &#8211; a piece of&nbsp;metal foil flew out of his mouth and stuck to my arm. I chuckled, pointed at it, and he picked it off my arm, and walked away.</p>
<p>Talk about bizarre, but even more bizarre is the fact that this man was the voice for the bumble bee man on the Simpsons.</p>
<p>100% of that story is true, although, I admit, parts of it were mere guesses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always forget how to create cookies in ColdFusion using the <span class="caps">CFHEADER</span> tag, so here&#8217;s a reminder:</p>
<p><code>&lt;cfheader name=&#8220;Set-Cookie&#8221; value=&quot;mycookie=pong;expires=<i>ddd, dd-mmm-yyyy HH:mm:ss <span class="caps">GMT</span></i><p>&#8220;&gt;</p><br />
<p>For a domain cookie:</p><br />
<p><code>&lt;cfheader name=&#8221;Set-Cookie&quot; value=&#8220;mycookie=pong;expires=<i>ddd, dd-mmm-yyyy HH:mm:ss</i> <span class="caps">GMT</span>; path=/; domain=.domain.com;&#8221;&gt;</code></p><br />
<p>Using <span class="caps">CFHEADER</span> gives you more control over setting cookies than something like <span class="caps">CFCOOKIE</span> or using <span class="caps">CFSET</span> would.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Working across multiple time zones can be a pain, especially when the differences are as great as eight hours or more. The <a href="http://www.applyitsoftware.com/clock/index.html" target="">ApplyIt! WorldTime Clock</a> <p>is simply perfect. I can create little digital or analog clocks that I can park anywhere (currently in the &#8220;status bar&#8221; area of my desktop).</p><br />
<p>One of my favorite things about it is that it supports WinAmp skins, which is simply great. I hate having no control over how things look, and the idea to support WinAmp skins is very smart. It only uses the typefaces from the skin (it doesn&#8217;t wrap anything bulky around the clock), but that&#8217;s just fine. Anything more would reduce the functionality.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m very much calendar driven recently, which means that I&#8217;m using Outlook a lot to pop up reminders. The problem is, creating simple &#8220;call this person&#8221; or &#8220;visit this site&#8221; type of reminders in Outlook is serious overkill. It creates a blocked out portion on your calendar, and it requires you have Outlook open, hogging resources, to get reminded. This morning, after weeks of using the WorldTime Clock, I figured out that it supports simple reminders. Right click on the clock, and you can add a reminder for that time zone that, once reminded, allows you to snooze the reminder for a user definable number of minutes, or dismiss it all together. The only thing I can&#8217;t seem to do is set a recurring reminder.</p><br />
<p>Overall I&#8217;m quite pleased with it, and it&#8217;s been very helpful. Highly recommended </p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/" target="">BlogShares</a> <p>for a while, which is a nice bit of fun, but in doing so I&#8217;ve discovered something disturbing.</p><br />
<p>In the game, you&#8217;re given $500.00 of virtual cash, and the object is to amass huge quantities of money buying and selling virtual shares in real life weblogs. It&#8217;s very well done, and refreshingly original. One of the points of Blogshares is to encourage people to look at newer, less known blogs, which is a good and worthy idea. You do have the opportunity to click through to quite a few blogs you might never see otherwise.</p><br />
<p>What I&#8217;m finding disturbing is that, after seeing perhaps a few hundred &#8220;unknown&#8221; blogs, I&#8217;ve noticed a trend. The following words drive me crazy, and far too many people are using them in the titles of their blogs. In a five minute period, I found (n) amount of blogs containing these words in their titles:</p><br />
<p>Musings (27)<br />Ramblings (21)<br />Random Thoughts (8)<br />Chaos (5)<br />Diversions (7)<br />Worthless Thoughts (3)<br />Loosely Coupled (3)<br /><br />
<p>Bear in mind that I found these words in blog titles not by searching for them specifically, but because within the game, they met a profile for weblogs that I thought were undervalued, and would perform well for me in the future. The frequency of those words is what disturbs me, and each word used disturbs me in different ways, which I&#8217;ll pontificate on:</p><br />
<p><strong>Musings<br /></strong>I hate this word. I picture a wannabe intellectual type lounging about his front parlour in a smoking jacket, pipe in hand saying &#8220;I fancy a moment of muse whilst the milk mixes with the Earl Grey&#8221; in a sickeningly fake British accent. It drives me crazy.</p><br />
<p><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />I have to admit, long ago before I knew what weblogs were, I referred to my weblog entries as ramblings, but I pretty quickly decided that I didn&#8217;t like the idea, and dropped it. My blog entries aren&#8217;t ramblings, they&#8217;re important to me. I spend some time thinking of them, and trying my best not to ramble.</p><br />
<p><strong>Random Thoughts<br /></strong>It&#8217;s not that maddening, but I&#8217;m just tired of seeing it. A little creativity would be nice. We all have random thoughts, so stating the obvious gets old quickly. What kind of thoughts are they, predominantly? Fish husbandry? Building circuit boards? Obsessing over Christina Aguillera? Horse racing? Surely something sticks out. For me, it&#8217;s bad milk and hating to get my haircut, yet hating my hair to be long.</p><br />
<p><strong>Chaos<br /></strong>People generally pick this word because it sounds mysterious and smart or something. If you&#8217;re telling me your weblog is chaotic, I&#8217;m not going to read it. I don&#8217;t want to deal with disorderly masses of letters, and I&#8217;m not smart enough to comprehend chaos when it comes to mathematics. Besides, if a weblog were truly in a state of chaos, it wouldn&#8217;t be a weblog, it would simply be a jumble of letters, following no particular order (except that the very electrons displaying the chaos follow a strict order, and then you can&#8217;t call it chaos anymore can you?).</p><br />
<p><strong>Diversions<br /></strong>Why use this? Does it too sound interesting like chaos? Calling it diversions is just another case of stating the obvious, and ultimately aren&#8217;t all weblogs diversions, laden with links to other places, arrived at while trying to avoid doing some meaningful work?</p><br />
<p><strong>Worthless Thoughts</strong><br />Fair enough perhaps. No need to check a weblog full of worthless thoughts. Besides, anyone who calls their thoughts worthless is probably trolling for sympathy of some sort, and I&#8217;m not the sympathetic type.</p><br />
<p><strong>Loosely Coupled</strong><br />I&#8217;m tired of buzz words. This one is climbing the buzz word ladder quickly. I don&#8217;t even know the origins of the term, but people are taking it and running with it because it sounds smart. Besides, I like very tightly organized things. I don&#8217;t want wishy washy relationships between busines processes or thoughts or whatever it is that you can couple loosely.</p><br />
<p>I guess the point of this moanfest is that I really do enjoy weblogs, and the power they give to ordinary people. I just wish these same people would spend a little more time putting some creative thought into what they call the process of writing a weblog. And please, don&#8217;t ever call it musings again. That one kills me the quickest. I could see <a href="http://www.beckham-magazine.com/" target="">David Beckham</a> saying it on his site.</p></p>
