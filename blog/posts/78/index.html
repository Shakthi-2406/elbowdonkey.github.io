  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s an email hoax making the rounds that suggests Nostradamus predicted September 11. This is indeed a hoax, and <a href="http://www.dreamscape.com/morgana/91101.htm" target="">this site</a> <p>does a good job debunking it.</p><br />
<p>In the hoax, the email lists two paragraphs of test that are supposed to have been written by Nostradamus in 1654 (he actually died in 1566). The second paragraph was written by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:geT9lnF7TGs:www.ed.brocku.ca/~nmarshal/nostradamus.htm&amp;hl=en" target="">someone</a> who was trying to point out the predictability of these kinds of vague prophecies. Before you forward that next email, question whether or not it is a <a href="http://purportal.com/special/9-11/" target="">hoax</a> &#8211; most forwarded letters are.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife is awesome. She works for a major airline at the ticket counter, and needless to say for the past few days she&#8217;s been under a lot of stress. I&#8217;ve heard it said that during times of crisis you see a persons true nature, and my wife is truly a compassionate, caring, and strong person. I wish I was capable of a mere fraction of those qualities. Hang in there Carrie, you&#8217;re doing a good thing.</p>

The Red Cross website is down most of the time due to the overwhelming response, so the best thing to do if you want to donate money is take advantage of Amazon&#8217;s technology.<br />
If you want to donate blood (and you should, even in times of peace) you should look in your local phone book to find the local facility and make an appointment to give, otherwise you could be waiting for a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up today to the phone ringing and the radio speaking of terrorist attacks on the Pentagon, the World Trade Towers, and perhaps even the White House. It&#8217;s been surreal ever since. Like most people with a blog I&#8217;ll share my thoughts as well, although I feel it almost tacky to be putting an entry up. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be glad I did when I re-read the entries a few years from now when the shock has lifted.<br />
- LA is saying &#8220;We&#8217;re safe, we&#8217;re prepared&#8221;. How? New York City could have said the same thing 5 minutes prior to the attack. Sure the planes are grounded, but that doesn&#8217;t guarantee safety.<br />
- This is easily the most devastating thing I have ever seen, and I know it&#8217;s not even over yet. I was just at the <span class="caps">USS</span> Arizona, and the death toll and stories of death are incredible, but it was against military targets in a time of war. The event today is obviously different, and while my thoughts of Pearl Harbour haven&#8217;t changed, it&#8217;s possible that as more information comes out I may feel today&#8217;s event was worse.<br />
- I have a friend from Germany who&#8217;s saying &#8220;This would never happen in Germany, people hate America&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think any country deserves what happened today.<br />
- I was just at the World Trade Center, it&#8217;s a bit hard to stomach that the <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/photo_journal.cfm?pa=display&amp;id=1027&amp;startrow=1">massive building</a> I took <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/photo_journal.cfm?pa=album&amp;id=17">pictures</a> from the top of is no longer there.<br />
- I&#8217;m concerned about what will happen next. I don&#8217;t want to see a war, but I don&#8217;t want to see someone getting away with this, certainly not some guerilla terrorist group.<br />
- I&#8217;m afraid for people who live in the US who&#8217;ve immigrated to this country from middle eastern countries who may face retalition from those caught up with rage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back up. What an ordeal. I won&#8217;t complain about the downtime, I&#8217;ll just resume as if it never happened. Thanks for hanging in there.</p>
<p>By the way, there are definately broken parts here and there. I&#8217;m still fixing everything, but because I&#8217;m with a new host I have less control than I did before, so it takes more time to fix things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dang, a whole month went by and I had to reset my server&#8217;s clock back to August 2nd again. I need to figure out why my <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server is expiring, but I&#8217;ve been so busy. I&#8217;m finishing my last two chapters of my book right now, and the second to last one is proving to be a mother load once again. Why is it that when I need to make a chapter bigger I can never do it, and when I need to make one smaller, I have to everything I can to chop it down to size?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re seeing this then you&#8217;re one of the lucky few. Excite@Home has <b>definately</b> blocked traffic to port 80 (which explains the redirect to port 2002). I&#8217;m working on getting the site hosted elsewhere.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know you&#8217;ve been writing technical documents too long when you start writing phrases like &#8220;Red Icon &#8211; Clicking on this will kill an innocent Ethiopian.&#8221; I have absolutely no desire for anyone to kill an innocent Ethiopian, but it&#8217;s what my fingers wanted me to type. Other favorites are:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;Editing the registry is likely to result in your violent death&#8221;<br />
<li>&#8220;Scoping variables in the <span class="caps">FORM</span> scope is good if you have problems with your self esteem&#8221;<br />
<li>&#8220;Enabling this setting is especially useful if you have multiple personality disorder&#8221;

<p>I thought for a second that it might be funny to write a spoof technical book, but it would only really be funny if it was 600 pages of pure funny stuff, published to look like a technical book, and to be snuck onto shelves next to technical books. Only technical book publishers would be able to truly pull this off, and I just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d be up to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading this sentence will make the insides of your feet itch&#8221; &#8211; sometimes my wife claims that the <i>insides</i>, as in deep down, of her feet itch. That must suck!</p>
