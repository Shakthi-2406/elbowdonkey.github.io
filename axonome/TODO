ISSUES:
+ rebuild test suite so all specs are running/passing
+ remove old a_star junk

- depth2.html demo is broken somehow
- refactor/cleanup tests, remove orphaned/unused code
+ test drive a*
- introduce unwalkable tiles
- introduce object collision (avatar on base tile bumps into a tile on same level is a collision)
- avatar zindexes aren't very functional - they need the same treatment as nodes
