  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aside from the random photos I&#8217;ll post, I&#8217;m not going to give much of a <span class="caps">SXSW</span> &#8216;05 report. It was all too much of a blur, and frankly, I&#8217;m sad it&#8217;s over despite the granting of my intense desire to see my wife and kids felt on the flight home. Already I&#8217;m forgetting the countless ideas and mountains of optimism expressed by nearly everyone I met. Decompressing from such a manic froth of creativity is sort of depressing.</p>
<p>Despite the deflation, I&#8217;m already looking forward to next year. I&#8217;m encouraging most everyone I know to attend so they too can take part in the idea+optimism hurricane. I&#8217;m cleaning my slate, narrowing down my projects, and freeing myself up to really make something of what I think is the return of the Good Times, Slightly Tempered. 2005 is starting to look pretty good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several people we&#8217;re interested in my Guinea Fowl piece created for the most recent <a href="http://www.20x2.org/">20&#215;2</a> event so I thought I&#8217;d share a bit about how it was created, link to the video, and also give away the &#8220;joke&#8221; about why I chose to paint a guinea fowl in the first place. And finally, I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7309081732">auctioning the piece starting today</a>. Spread the word.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/20x2take2final2.mov"><img width="240" height="186" src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/DSC_9425_1_240.jpeg" /></a></p>
<div class="googleAds" style="padding:15px;">
</div>
<p>My &#8220;studio&#8221; is really just a corner of my home office that I set aside so that I could easily capture digital video straight to my G5&#8217;s hard drive. The tripod straddles the desk, and one of its legs is indeed taped to the wall with masking tape. It&#8217;s very solid. Normally I give myself a bit more room, but video capture put some constraints on that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/DSC_9420_1.html"><img src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/DSC_9420_1-thumb.jpg" width="537" height="357" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Before doing the illustration I did a sketch on paper. For best results, I should have done several mockups on paper first, but I was running out of time. I also have a photograph of a guinea fowl for reference. To the right are a bunch of bottles of Liquitex Concentrated Acrylics. Accept no substitutes, this stuff is the best. Perfect consistency, excellent pigments, long lasting.</p>
<p>The music in the video is done by a folk singer named Almeda Riddle and is based on an old Scottish folk song. The song is used in the opening credits of the movie Gummo which in itself is sort of a 2 hour moving illustration. I added the chainsaw sounds for dramatic effect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/DSC_9425_1.html"><img src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/DSC_9425_1-thumb.jpg" width="537" height="416" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So why a guinea fowl? First of all, I loved this song, and was always struck by the choice of animal noises. Most would agree that a pig says &#8220;oink oink&#8221;, but in her version, it says &#8220;mmm mmm&#8221;. But then there&#8217;s the guinea fowl. She says it says &#8220;pad-a-rack&#8221; which is totally crazy (though I&#8217;ve never heard a guinea fowl, I assume this is crazy). Upon hearing pad-a-rack, I&#8217;m just sort of baffled, and end up saying &#8220;What?&#8221; as proof of that bafflement. The theme to 20&#215;2 this year was &#8220;What&#8217;s the word?&#8221; which admittedly is not the same as saying &#8220;What&#8217;s <span class="caps">THAT</span> word?&#8221; but offered me a chance to show off 4 hours of illustrating in 2 minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If ever you find yourself wondering if an interactive entity is something other than human, and most likely a robot in your day to day life, here are some trick questions that will help shake out the truth:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Are you a boy or a girl?&#8221;<br />
Robots are neither, and therefore wouldn&#8217;t be able to answer. Most robots will try to spin it in their favor by saying &#8220;Yes&#8221;, or &#8220;I am neither&#8221; which should raise a red flag.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Have you eaten an ice lolly today?&#8221;<br />
Robots have no tastebuds and therefore cannot eat ice lollies. Typical evasive counter attacks include &#8220;I do not like ice lollies&#8221; which you know is impossible, all humans love ice lollies. Also, the fact that a robot would understand what ice lolly even meant would mean that someone programmed him to speak British. Robot makers don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Did you see that mute grab?&#8221;<br />
Robots will be confused by this. During their computations, they will come to two possible conclusions to the meaning of the question. If they have a display, they can show you two possible computer generated images. The image of a white faced pantomime grabbing someone in the face, their fingers digging in like humans are apt, or someone performing a board sport related maneuver.  You should only ask this if neither of those two things have happened within sight of the robot.</p>
<p>4. &#8220;Have you told your parents you&#8217;re gay?&#8221;<br />
Obviously this is the atom bomb of trick questions for robots. Robots have no parents, have no sexual preferences, and finally would get tripped up by the possible double meaning of the word gay. If you&#8217;re in a hurry, you can use this one and skip the others. Robot responses might include upper level <span class="caps">ASCII</span> characters which might mess with your interface, so be aware ahead of time.</p>
<p>5. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to 7-11, would you like me to get you something?&#8221;<br />
Robots compute things, and will read the questions as &#8220;I&#8217;m going to -4, would you like me to get you something?&#8221; For robots, &#8220;going to -4&#8221; is the universal code for &#8220;kill all the humans&#8221; and will trigger their human killing response. This will surely reveal their underlying robot structure as if you are in the same room, you will immediately become engaged in man versus robot combat. If they are somewhere across the globe and you are chatting with them via email, they will launch nuclear weapons if they can, and you will be able to verify their underlying robot structure by the news reports.</p>
<p>I suggest you print this out, fold it up, and put it in your wallet for future reference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a gopher in my yard visiting from Hades proper and is constructing The Great Buffington Catacombs and I&#8217;ve been trying to kill him. Yesterday I stood outside one of his newest holes and waited like a crane waits for the right moment to snatch a frog out of the water. I waited with my <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=1551088&amp;cat=4845&amp;type=1&amp;dept=5428&amp;path=0%3A5428%3A4091%3A111649%3A4845">Garden Claw</a>, hoping that if he simply poked his upper half out long enough like I&#8217;d observed a dozen times I could give him some of the Claw and see what he thought about that.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes went by when he finally came out, and I watched and waited, very slowly getting the Garden Claw closer and closer, thinking all the while that to do a proper job I needed a proper recoil so the tool could gain maximum velocity. I considered that his reflexes were quicker than mine, and that maybe I needed to dispense with the recoil and just pin the critter. All the while, my blood was pumping like I was about to get into a fist fight. I considered this as well, and then adrenaline booted and reason out of my head as I flew into a blind rage, screamed a fantastic Rambo scream, and lunged at the eight inch gopher with my Garden Claw. My neighbor Chuck is worried about me. I missed the gopher.</p>
<p>I waited another twenty minutes for him to come back up, but he never did. I may have scared him to death (I hope) because there is no sign of new activity. He&#8217;s probably laying low, or maybe bleeding in his lair. If he never shows again, we won&#8217;t know until someone breaks their ankle in one of his holes and finds him, Claw wound evident, or petrified in fear. If the latter is true, I&#8217;d like to use him as a paper weight.</p>
<p>As I was driving home from lunch today I blasted the AC, and immediately began smelling sulfur, the same smell as the Great Destroyer smoke bombs I&#8217;d tried on the gopher prior to going Rambo. I thought it was odd, when I realized something. The times I&#8217;d bent over earlier in the week and examined a new gopher hole and smelled sulfur were not indications that the sulfur smoke had travelled and still lingered in the network of tunnels, but were instead indications that my shoes had picked up the smell from trapping the smoke in by standing on the hole. So now I need new shoes and a new lawn.</p>
<p>And it turns out all those meatballs didn&#8217;t give everyone the farts, it was the shoes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I remember forcing myself awake to tell Carrie something that I thought was fascinating. Still in a sloshy sort of sleep, I said &#8220;Carrie, I wonder why the kids are so calm right now. Listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fell back asleep before getting her reaction. Later, while asleep, I considered forcing myself awake to tell her to marvel at the prickliness of the stubble of my beard. It was in its &#8220;most prickly&#8221; stage where the whiskers are grown out enough to feel, but too short to bend under pressure. It was as interesting to me, there in my sleep, as a gang of spider monkeys building a Volkswagen bus might be. It was something that simple <b>had</b> to be shared.</p>
<p>It reminds me that I&#8217;ve been wanting to play pranks lately (which likely means I need to get out of the house more often), but one of those pranks which I&#8217;ll ruin by talking about now is to pretend to make a &#8220;pop&#8221; sound in my sleep. I&#8217;m not sure if I could pull it off without laughing, but at 2:00AM I&#8217;ve been tempted to say <b>&#8220;<span class="caps">POP</span>&#8221;</b> about as loud as I can without yelling just to see what happens. I know full well that if I did it, I&#8217;d pay for it somehow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I understand that it&#8217;s not your fault I spent my entire weekend reducing a truck sized pile of dark hemlock mulch on my driveway by shoveling endless shovel loads into a wheelbarrow and transporting it to my backyard. You didn&#8217;t make me peel back several square yards of my lawn purely for the aesthetics of it. You didn&#8217;t send the gopher, or is it a nutria, to my yard to dig a metropolis of tunnels under the lawn, poking up to check things out every so often to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>But please, I beg you. On the next release of Safari could you please move the back button somewhere not so close to the little red pill button that closes my browser window, including whatever ten tabs I had open that I instantly forget about when my browser disappears as I intend to click &#8220;Back&#8221;, but because my arms are so sore from hauling Earth that I miss.</p>
<p>And, if it&#8217;s not too much to ask, could do you have any tips of encouraging covers to leave (no holds barred). Thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My buddy Al started an aptly named weblog called <a href="http://www.misadventuresofal.blogspot.com/">The Misadventures of Al</a> in which he details his life. Note that the wording of that last sentence was quite deliberate &#8211; I worked with Al at Xerox, and nearly every morning there was a story about how either a kid puked, a tree fell on his powerlines, he missed a flight with his three kids and twenty pieces of luggage, or some other once-a-year-for-everyone-else event.</p>
<p>At Xerox, the phrase was often uttered (mostly to poke fun) &#8220;It&#8217;s Al&#8217;s Fault&#8221; due to his relationship with bad things happening. Al takes his misadventures in stride, and I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s decided to share them with everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to learn <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> lately because I&#8217;m seeing <a href="http://www.43things.com/">nice</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">applications</a> spring up that use it. Last night I got to thinking about how it&#8217;s difficult to learn a new programming language and how if you don&#8217;t have this &#8220;learn it or starve&#8221; attitude, you&#8217;ll simply dip your toes in and move on when the thinking gets too heavy.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Then I thought about why I&#8217;ve not been out of work for the past 10 years. It&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve positioned myself as an expert in something after learning a new skill. 10 years ago (ok, maybe 9.5) I picked up ColdFusion because I would have basically been out of a job if I didn&#8217;t. Early on I decided that I needed to be an expert at it, and I slowly started towards that goal. Over those 10 years, the opportunities that have presented themselves because of that skill have been fantastic. Have I earned $1M in the course of ten years? Not quite, but close, which gets me to thinking:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Carrie and I watch Survivor, The Apprentice, and The Amazing Race pretty closely. We TiVo all three, and when the kids are asleep we slip into &#8220;reality&#8221;. In each show, there&#8217;s this goal everyone is working for. In Survivor and The Amazing Race, it&#8217;s a $1M prize. People on each show put themselves through exhausting tasks for merely the chance to win. They&#8217;ll trash friendships,  eat grubs, risk personal injury, lie, cheat, steal, whatever it takes. They disrupt their lives for a month or so and give it everything they have. As if their lives depend on it.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
I argue that learning a new skill and becoming a specialist in that skill presents a much more sure chance at earning $1M, and that alone should provide enough motivation to get over the uncomfortable and difficult learning curve to obtain that new skill. It might take 10 years to earn it, but what would you do with an instant $1M anyhow? Live off of it or blow it?</p>
<p></p><p><br />
All I need to do to earn a million dollar skill is study up, memorize some stuff, experiment, try out the skill, fail, learn from failure, and continue. That&#8217;s certainly easier and more comfortable sounding than eating grubs and coconuts on a deserted island rolling in my own filth where everyone you see is out to rip a chance of $1M out of your hands and be happy to do it.</p>
