  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last week or so I&#8217;ve been convinced that I&#8217;ve moved into a neighborhood with a shooting range near by. Often I&#8217;ll hear the distant pop pop pop sound of a gun, and think &#8220;This is Oregon, not Santa Ana, it&#8217;s a shooting range&#8221;.</p>
<p>This morning, ten minutes before my alarm clock went off I was shaken out of bed by the very near and very loud sound of a machine gun. <strong><span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span>!</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was imagined in my sleep, or real, so I did what anyone would do and said loudly &#8220;What the hell was that?&#8221;. That&#8217;s about as close as I get to cursing, so this was quite the statement for me at 6:50am. Carrie said &#8220;I dunno&#8221; in her half asleep state. I laid awake, pondering what this noise was when it happened again.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span> <span class="caps">POP</span>!</strong></p>
<p>Only three bursts this time. I peeked out the window. There it was again, to my left. I looked up, and what did I see? A big fat stinky woodpecker, pecking the side of my apartment like a big dumb idiot.</p>
<p>I finally understand Woody Woodpecker.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Frustration begins with F. The letter F starts with the sound &#8220;eh&#8221;. Draw that sound out, put your&nbsp;gut into it, hold for&nbsp;twenty seconds,&nbsp;and you get the sound I make as realize that the time I&#8217;ve spent trying to learn a new technology has produced nothing by a long drawn out sound of frustration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been tasked with solving a problem at&nbsp;my new job&nbsp;that I have no compentancy in. My technical lead doesn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with this, but for me it&#8217;s the source of great frustration. I&#8217;m brand new on the job, and I want to be able to quickly affirm that they hired the right person for the job. I can&#8217;t do that when I&#8217;m tackling a huge learning curve, and it&#8217;s frustrating.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed that this happens alot. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Give the contractor something to do while we figure out where he best fits in.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what to do about that troublesome trend.</p>
<p>I do know that when I finally tackle the learning curve, I&#8217;m going to make some kick ass tutorials that will save someone in my current situation from having to produce cave man like noises. It&#8217;s my offering to &#8220;technical karma&#8221;. Promise to make it easier for someone, and the &#8220;technical karma&#8221; will pre-bless me with ease of learning. It will hit any second now, I&#8217;m sure of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Obversations, thoughts, and experiences&nbsp;made and gained&nbsp;while relocating to the Portland area:</p>
<p><strong>California</strong></p>
<p>While eating Arby&#8217;s before getting on the road, Carrie says &#8220;Hey, is that your Dad&#8217;s friend?&#8221;. Before I get the chance to say &#8220;That&#8217;s the third time I&#8217;ve seen that wobbly headed freak walk by carrying an unopened can of Coke and a 32 ounce bottle of brown Gatorade since we sat down&#8221; she waves at him. He begins to head over to&nbsp;return her friendliness, stops about ten feet away, makes a noise unintelligable, then heads off in another direction in his now familiar wobbly fashion to my relief. We&#8217;ve placed this experience into the &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; category<sup><a href="#hairbraid">1</a><p>. </p><br />
<p>Fresno smells like rotten salad. There&#8217;s no real explanation. My theory is that it has something to do with the name Fresno. That was a big mistake made&nbsp;by the founding fathers of the city.</p><br />
<p>If it&#8217;s a Taco Bell, and it&#8217;s on Interstate 5 between the&nbsp;Grape Vine and, let&#8217;s be safe and just say the border of Oregon, don&#8217;t be tempted to eat there. Let this be a lesson to you: if the floor in the Taco Bell is supposed to be blue, but really looks black, then your food&nbsp;simply cannot taste as good, even if it&#8217;s in it&#8217;s most pure form.</p><br />
<p>Mount Shasta looks edible. It looks like a treat from Dairy Queen. Vanilla ice cream with hot fudge dribbled all over it. It would, however, be very difficult to eat, even if you only consider the shear volume.</p><br />
<p>At night, people think I&#8217;m shining my brights. I&#8217;m not. I have a truck, it rides a bit higher than a standard car, pickup, or <span class="caps">SUV</span>.&nbsp;Oncoming motorists&nbsp;flash their brights at me, at which point I feel it&#8217;s my responsibility as an American to defend their accusations and shine brights at them as quickly as possible&nbsp;to show them that I, indeed, am not being forgetful or discourteous and leaving my brights on. Perhaps if I showed a little less glee in doing this at almost every car that passes, Carrie would agree with my handling of the situation. While I can&#8217;t speak for her, I have an idea that she thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;a stupid guy thing&#8221;.</p><br />
<p>Don&#8217;t sleep in Fresno, even at a Super 8 Hotel. You&#8217;d think that the Super 8 Hotel is better by a magnitude of 2 compared to the Hotel 6. If this is so, then the Hotel 6 in Fresno must use piles of fluffed dirt for pillows, and slabs of recycled concrete for mattresses (no high quality slabs of granite in this metaphor).</p><br />
<p><strong>Oregon</strong></p><br />
<p>Grass. Look at all the grass. There must be thousands of square miles of grass to our left and right. Look, a sign that says &#8220;Grass Capital of the World&#8221;. No kidding.</p><br />
<p>Green. It&#8217;s very green here. It looks like we&#8217;re going to need some good umbrellas. It&#8217;s also very clean.</p><br />
<p>We arrived in Wilsonville late Saturday night. We were too tired to find the apartment, and couldn&#8217;t move in until Sunday anyhow, so we got a room. For the same price we paid for a dump in Fresno at the Super 8, we got a very nice, and very clean room at a Comfort Inn in Wilsonville. The next morning, we openened the blinds to the room, and what did my eyes behold? Across&nbsp;a field of grass stood a Fry&#8217;s Electronics. My love/hate relationship with the store would continue. The hate would be less as I came to find out last night. No sales tax in Oregon. Not a dime. And, not just one, but three people offered to help me find items in Fry&#8217;s. A miracle.</p><br />
<p>Sunday morning we moved into our apartment. An apartment complex of this quality in Southern California would cost triple for what we are paying in Oregon. No exaggeration.</p><br />
<p>Our apartment is now fully furnished and very livable. Cable modem and telephone get installed this week.</p><br />
<p><sup><a name="hairbraid">1</a></sup>I had a roommate when I was younger who decided to also invite his father in law to stay with us. It was actually his ex-wife&#8217;s father in law, and rather than try and explain that, I&#8217;ll get right into the explanation of the &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; category of experiences.</p><br />
<p>This new roommate slept on the couch, falling asleep to pornos. Again, more room for explanation that I will gloss over for the sake of brevity. And yes, this wasn&#8217;t a comfortable home environment for me. I changed that pretty quick, but I digress. This new roommate was an old man with very long, greasy biker hair. I seem to recall his beard was as long as his hair, and both had probably been growing without fear of scissors in their whole existance. This was wild man hair.</p><br />
<p>Carrie and I weren&#8217;t married yet. She came by to visit one time. I was in my room doing something, and she came bursting in, quickly shutting the door behind her. She was obviously very distraught, and in some kind of fix.</p><br />
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;I just told your roommate I&#8217;d braid his hair!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;<strong>What?</strong> You&#8217;re <em>crazy!</em>&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean too! He asked &#8216;Do you know how to braid hair?&#8217; and I said &#8216;Yes&#8217; then he said &#8216;Could you braid <em>my</em> hair?&#8217; and I said &#8216;Yes&#8217; and then I realized what I said and ran in here, what do I do?!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>Now you understand why Carrie and I have a classification of experiences called the &#8220;Sure I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; experiences. Carrie is winning so far, with two confirmed experiences against my zero.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Four days to move an entire household one thousand miles away. Today I get to dismantle a well established 55 gallon saltwater reef aquarium. All things considered, the tank weighs nearly 650 pounds when full. I&#8217;ll be draining it, placing all the live items in buckets, and taking them down to the local fish store.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, I&#8217;ll be packing up my 5 gallon <a href="/mb/images/aquarium/" target="_self">desktop reef</a><p>, and taking everything with me to Oregon. I simply can&#8217;t part with this little thing, it&#8217;s about as close to South Pacific as I&#8217;ll ever find in Oregon.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m also taking my UltimateTV receiver and satellite dish to Oregon, and I&#8217;m not going to tell DirecTV about it. That way I&#8217;ll still be able to get local Los Angeles channels, and still be able to record a show&nbsp;and then fast forward through all the commercials.</p><br />
<p>I have two more days of packing and moving, and already this morning my bones ache. It&#8217;s hard work, but reward awaits.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s official. I&#8217;ll be calling Portland Oregon my new home for at least the next three months, possibly even the next eighteen months. I&#8217;ll actually be living and working in <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;addr=&amp;city=Wilsonville&amp;state=OR&amp;csz=Wilsonville,+OR&amp;slt=45.299671&amp;sln=-122.770950&amp;name=&amp;zip=&amp;country=us&amp;&amp;BFKey=&amp;BFCat=&amp;BFClient=&amp;mag=7&amp;desc=&amp;cs=8&amp;newmag=6&amp;poititle=&amp;poi=&amp;ds=n" target="_blank">Wilsonville</a><p>, which is about 25 minutes southwest of downtown <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;addr=&amp;city=Portland&amp;state=OR&amp;csz=Portland,+OR&amp;slt=45.523830&amp;sln=-122.675346&amp;name=&amp;zip=&amp;country=us&amp;&amp;BFKey=&amp;BFCat=&amp;BFClient=&amp;mag=7&amp;desc=&amp;cs=8&amp;newmag=8&amp;poititle=&amp;poi=&amp;ds=n" target="_blank">Portland</a>.</p><br />
<p>Once when I was kid, probably twelve or thirteen, my family sat down to discuss the possibility of moving out of state. Not knowing this moment was coming, it&#8217;s a surprise that I was able to, within seconds, launch an all out assualt against this new idea.</p><br />
<p>I swore I&#8217;d pull my guts right out of my skin if they made me leave the Pacific Ocean, and that I&#8217;d become the problem child from the darkest side Hell if they dare moved an inch further to the east. I&#8217;d carve disturbing symbols into my skin in prominent locations, and I&#8217;d begin hunting neighborhood cats with my new homemade crossbow with bolts dipped in poison made from my baby sister&#8217;s bile.</p><br />
<p>We enjoyed several more years of Southern California living, and once I was sure we were still firmly planted, I confessed that all my threats were emtpy.</p><br />
<p>Now, over ten years later, pulling out my own guts isn&#8217;t an option, and in fact is one of the last things I&#8217;d like to do. I&#8217;m actually looking forward to Oregon, not simply because of a nice job, but because it&#8217;s the kind of adventure that I&#8217;m learning to love. The challenge of having to find a new place to live within a week in a place I&#8217;ve never been is very exciting. It&#8217;s stepping way outside my comfort zone, and it&#8217;s thrilling.</p><br />
<p>I don&#8217;t leave everything behind though. It turns out that Oregon has some of the best skateparks in the world, including the legendary <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/ddResults.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;tarname=&amp;tardesc=&amp;osd=&amp;newname=&amp;newdesc=&amp;dsd=&amp;newHash=&amp;newTHash=&amp;newErr=&amp;newTErr=&amp;newFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;newaddr=&amp;newcsz=wilsonville%2C+or&amp;newcountry=us&amp;newTFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;newtaddr=&amp;newtcsz=Newberg%2C+" target="_blank">Newberg</a> park built by the <a href="http://www.dreamlandskateparks.com/" target="_blank">Dreamland Team</a>. Even if you&#8217;re not into skateboarding, you have to appreciate the beauty of this <a href="http://www.dreamlandskateparks.com/newberg.htm" target="_blank">place</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some things can make a grown man cry, and I mean this with the utmost sincerity. I mentioned the other day that someone had stolen my skateboard, and how upset I was about it.</p>
<p>About ten or twenty minutes ago&nbsp;I was finishing up some changes on a new ColdFusion tutorial. My attention was undivided towards finishing the article. I&#8217;d had been struggling with it for some time, and was highly focused on&nbsp;getting it done so I could go to sleep. My office is pretty dark as was the rest of the house. Carrie had gone to sleep early. </p>
<p>Around 10:45PM I started getting paranoid, thinking I&#8217;d heard a noise on the porch. It&#8217;s not abnormal to hear noise; we share a staircase with my neighbor and he often comes home around this time, but since someone had just stolen from me I was a bit on edge, assuming they might come back to take my shoes this time (they might be worth something to someone, they&#8217;re basically my &#8220;work on dirty stuff&#8221; shoes and are worth little to me now, but they had their day in the sun). </p>
<p>Just as I was figuring out where the nearest phone was in case I had to call an ambulance for whoever was brave enough to make a second visit, woodpecker-like noises started coming from my aquarium. Now, I have two saltwater reef aquariums in my office which I&#8217;ll talk about another time, but in one, a particular hermit crab has a certain habit of humping the other hermit crabs in a machine-gun-like fashion. It&#8217;s pretty noisy business. Since I was so deep in my work, I figured the noises I&#8217;d heard were due to this love machine hermit crab.</p>
<p>I posted the article, wrote a blog entry about it, closed my laptop, stood up to go hit the sack, and thought I better check the office window to make sure it was locked. Through the blinds, I caught a glimpse of a shiny new skateboard. Heart attack. Confusion. The noises I had heard actually were from someone coming to my porch, not Humping Hermit, but this time the noises were from something I could have never guessed.</p>
<p>Some things can make a grown man cry.</p>
<p>It took me about thirty minutes to reach out and pick it up. Like Willy Wonka and the golden ticket, I didn&#8217;t believe it. It wasn&#8217;t until I got a call from &#8220;George&#8221; who claimed he was instructed to call me and was told to tell me to &#8220;look down on your porch&#8221; that I actually opened the door and picked it up. When asked who he really was he said &#8220;I&#8217;m not at liberty to tell, just following instructions, and besides, you wouldn&#8217;t know me anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sincere thanks to whoever did this. Now I need to go pay it forward.</p>

<p>For instance, here&#8217;s an insightful list, ordered in no particular order:</p>
