<p>A new <span class="caps">MIT</span> institute aims to produce <a target="" href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/tech/article.jsp?id=99992043&amp;sub=Nanotechnology">fabrics with morphing camouflage</a><p>, that can also store energy to <a target="" href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/tech/article.jsp?id=99992043&amp;sub=Nanotechnology">increase the wearer&#8217;s strength</a>.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for the day when I can paint my walls with a nano paint, and control the wallpaper from my computer. It&#8217;s those little ideas that can be accomplished with nanotechonology that will change our lives (or our kids lives).</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to talk extensively about nanobots. I was thinking of nanobot suits, nanobots vehicles, nanobot shoes, all sorts of ideas, and then for a while I stopped dead in my tracks. It wasn&#8217;t because I realized that nanobots as I saw them would probably never happen, because I already knew that. I can&#8217;t say exactly what stopped the nanobot craze, but I can say it&#8217;s slowly creeping back.</p>
<p>My wife was relating the story of a plane that ran out of fuel and made a powerless emergency landing on a small Island off of spain. Midway through her description of how the plane lost fuel, I began think up nanobot related solutions to that problem, namely, the nanobot flight suit. Imagine a suit with billions of microscoping wings that could fly you to safety in the event of a plane crash, or for leisure.</p>
<p>For a long while I wanted to have a site displaying my nanobot related ideas, and I think I may pursue that again soon. I&#8217;m picturing hand drawn illustrations of nano inventions. That will be fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I began tearing apart my attic with crowbars and sledgehammers. All the events leading up to last night make for a dull story, so I summarize it in one sentence. The previous homeowner built and finished three rooms in the attic, which the homeowner&#8217;s association discovered while I own it, and they&#8217;ve claimed the space as common association space that they own and that I will have to pay to get removed. So there. It&#8217;s stupid, I know, but we&#8217;ve been in a legal battle over it for a while, so I decided to make their case a little weaker by just getting rid of it myself.</p>
<p>They wanted to charge us $5000 big ones to restore the attic to original condition, which is robbery considering I took down one of three rooms last night in less than 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I should mention that there are few things in this world more satisfying than swinging a crowbar right into a wall, mixing near-obscenities with the name of the <span class="caps">HOA</span>. Working as a developer my entire life, nothing I produce is ever &#8220;real&#8221;, or tangible, it&#8217;s all digital. Tearing down a wall is tangible, it&#8217;s real, it&#8217;s true productivity.</p>
<p>Also, last night I had a dream that I was lost in South Central LA dressed up as the easter bunny. I was safe with the costume on, but I lifted the mask to ask for directions at one point, and suddenly I was public enemy number one, so I put the mask back on for safety.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I don&#8217;t see &#8220;Work from home&#8221; signs as much as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cockeyed.com/">Rob</a> <p>does, I&#8217;d love to see Rob <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cockeyed.com/workfromhome/workfromhome.html">fight</a> a big bad multi level marketing company like Herbalife and win.</p><br />
<p>Apparently almost every &#8220;Work at home and earn $300-5000 a week&#8221; sign that you see was put up by someone trying to make a buck selling Herbalife products. There are laws against plastering these signs everywhere that Herbalife is immune to because they can&#8217;t be held responsible for their independant distributor&#8217;s actions.</p><br />
<p>Rob asked that those who have an audience link to his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cockeyed.com/workfromhome/workfromhome.html">report</a>, which I have done gladly. I encourage others to do the same. I&#8217;ve seen too many struggling young adults fall for these scams, and it&#8217;s usually the last thing they need as they try to establish themselves financially.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img height="285" alt="new feet" src="/mb/images/feet.jpg" width="292" align="left" border="0" />Feet. Look at that word enough times and it almost doesn&#8217;t make sense. Seems like a made up word. You check the spelling several times to make sure it&#8217;s correct. With a nurse&#8217;s strange juxtapostion over ghostly images of feet no bigger than my thumbnail it seems even more strange and unbelievable.</p>
<p>Reminds me of several weeks ago looking at a pregnancy test. &#8220;Is it true?!&#8221; we kept asking eachother. &#8220;This is the third one that has two bars, it has to be true!&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it <em>is</em> <p>true! We&#8217;re going to have a <strong>baby</strong>! It&#8217;s real!</p></p>
