  <div class="entry-content"><p>I caught a lizard in my cube this morning at work. That&#8217;s right, a lizard. If I had my cam on me I&#8217;d take a picture of it as proof. This same lizard was sighted the other day basking in the sun on the other side of my cube, and today it just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and I caught it. It&#8217;s a baby, only 1.5 inches long with the tail, and it&#8217;s name is The Beast. I have it trapped in a little wooden box right now, and we&#8217;re thinking of getting a little terrarium and keeping it as a company mascot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past few days as I&#8217;ve been driving to work I&#8217;ve begun to recognize the cars of other commuters. This is really kind of weird, considering how many drivers there are on a six lane freeway in Southern California.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a day when dynamic sites were still young. In that day, I created a site called <a href="/cause/" target="_parent">The Cause</a><p>&nbsp;that became very popular at one point, and was even featured in the New York Times in 1997. I thought I had lost the code for the site in a hard drive crash a few years ago, but it turns out <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/" target="_parent">Erik</a>&nbsp;had saved the code somewhere (a fact just realized a few weeks ago).</p><br />
<p>The site itself was a kind of big joke that got very big very quick, and it hasn&#8217;t changed since. The <span class="caps">HTML</span> coding is still the quick and dirty code originally written an hour after the idea occurred, and the database still runs on Microsoft Access (something that I will most likely change very soon).</p><br />
<p>The site is back, and alive, and there are plans to return it&#8217;s traffic to traditional levels, and get it back the big crazy mess it once was. Check it out!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I went to Dairy Queen last night for a sweet treat, and there was a young man serving us through the drive through window. I can&#8217;t say he was the typical young teenage American male because for one, he was working at Dairy Queen, and if we remember back to teenage years, Dairy Queen employees&nbsp;were always&nbsp;freaks. Just because we&#8217;re now 10 years older doesn&#8217;t change a thing in that regard.</p>
<p>So, as he is preparing my Brownie Earthquake, he&#8217;s doing what I&#8217;ve since dubbed &#8220;drive by patriotism&#8221;. As he was walking past the two by two foot window, he&#8217;d lean down and say &#8220;I donated two pints of blood today&#8221;, or &#8220;America rocks&#8221;. It was really wierd, because as soon as he had said it, he&#8217;d be gone, only to come back and say something again.</p>
<p>The last thing he did as we were driving away was lean out the window, and yell &#8220;God Bless America&#8221;. I enjoy the enthusiasm, but it was just a bit wierd. Half way through the event I told Carrie that this kid was making&nbsp; my site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie bought new pillows. She decided it would be best if she bought herself a $20 pillow, complete with $5 pillow cover (this goes under a pillow case). She decided to splurge on her sweet husband and by a pillow for him as well. A fine, quality above any other, pillow for $4.99.</p>
<p>I already have a plan in place; wait until nightfall, and switch pillows when she&#8217;s in dreamland, then enjoy sweet $20 pillow dreams all night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t chicken out on the hair thing. As I lifted the scissors to my head in preparation for the first snip, my wife called from her work and asked what I was doing. I couldn&#8217;t lie, so I said &#8220;I&#8217;m about to cut my own hair&#8221;. She ended up convincing me that the $12 bucks I&#8217;d spend at SuperCuts would be far less uncomfortable than having to live with a do it yourself haircut.</p>
<p>But I will say this. I hate having material that grows out of my head on a constant basis. If I could harvest it for something and get paid I might enjoy my quick grow hair. If I could spray something on my hair, or take a pill to make it stop growing, that would be fine too. I don&#8217;t so much hate the hair, I hate having to get it cut all the time. It&#8217;s an awful cycle. Grow hair, complain about how fast hair grows, cut hair, repeat.</p>
<p>On that note, maybe I&#8217;d be happy with one of <a href="http://www.flowbee.com/" target="_parent">these</a><p>.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I need a haircut. I&#8217;m considering at this very moment to cut it myself. It&#8217;s long enough so that I can do the &#8220;cut off what sticks out between your fingers method&#8221;, and if that doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m not at all opposed to buzzing it all off. Wish me luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m using a new editing tool for my news entries that I think is pretty cool. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.siteobjects.com/" target="">ezEdit </a>and makes it, oddly enough, very easy to add new entries with links and formatting and stuff like that. Typically I&#8217;ve just had a simple text area form to put stuff in, and it&#8217;s just not as good as doing it that way.</p>
