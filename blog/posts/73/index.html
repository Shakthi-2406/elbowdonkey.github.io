  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I just don&#8217;t know when to quit. I&#8217;ve been trying to be &#8220;productive&#8221; on a computer today and so far I&#8217;ve managed to completely mangle two computers within a five hour window. </p>
<p>I also got stuck on a ledge in my house. The ledge is in my bathroom, and my goal was to put some Christmas lights up there. The ledge itself is about thirteen feet off the ground, and I have no ladder.</p>
<p>I tossed the lights up to the ledge where there&#8217;s an outlet controlled by a switch in the room, then put a barstool below the ledge. When standing on the barstool, the ledge is about a foot above my head still. Not exactly high enough to simply lay out the lights and plug them in. I wasn&#8217;t going to succeed unless I got on the ledge.</p>
<p>So I pulled my self up, using nothing but my impressive arm muscles and cat like instincts. The edge of the ledge is rounded, between and inch and a two inch radius, which makes it difficult to really grab hold of, so that was scary. The ledge is also&nbsp;about a foot deep, and 2 feet high, leaving little room to do anything once there.</p>
<p>I laid out the lights, plugged them in, then realized I was thirteen feet off the ground, the closest object being a barstool about 7 feet away. I weighed my options. I could jump, which might either hurt really bad, or not a lot. There was going to be some pain if I jumped, and possible damage to my condo (hole in floor). My other option was to try and jump off and land on the bar stool, reducing the distance I&#8217;d have to jump. I&#8217;d either land on it, then have to jump off again to the floor immediately, or my weight wouldn&#8217;t land right and it would shoot off in one direction while I ended up horiztonal on my way to floor. The idea of&nbsp;doing a belly flop on a hardwood floor wasn&#8217;t tops on my list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I took the third and final option. I put my trust yet again in my impressive arm muscles and cat like instincts and began to&nbsp;lower my entire body from the ledge to the bar stool. At one point when all my weight was being supported by nothing but my hands, they began to slip on the rounded ledge corner. I thought I was a goner, so rather than react to a fall I was preemptive and pushed off the ledge with the intentions of missing the barstool below me, and landing with my feet square on the floor. I forgot about the counter top behind me, and ended up taking a seat in the bathroom sink, which suprisingly didn&#8217;t hurt at all (I&#8217;d just fallen about 5 or 6 feet into it).</p>
<p>By the way, before thinking of the third option, I spent about 45 minutes trying to figure out what to do. I&#8217;m a big dummy sometimes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a funny thing I wrote down a while back; a story that my wife Carrie told me. I can&#8217;t remember if I ever posted it or not so I&#8217;ll just post it again:</p>
<p><strong>My wife telling the story:</strong></p>
<p>I was at an ice cream store, and a 20 something guy with his girlfriend were in line in front of me.&nbsp; At this particular store you can choose between a cone with chocolate and nuts on it, or chocolate and sprinkles</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want sprinkles or nuts?&#8221; the kid asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well what do you think?! Nuts of course!&#8221; the twenty something guy literally yells.</p>
<p>I thought the guy was out of control, a little bit scary, but in the back of the shop a grey haired lady was giggling, and I thought that the little old lady had a dirty mind for laughing at the nuts reference:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a pervert!&#8221; I thought.&nbsp;&#8220;That little old lady has a dirty mind and laughing about the nuts&#8221;</p>
<p>I started laughing out loud because of the little lady. I thought the guy was obnoxious, but the lady laughing was pretty&nbsp;funny.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at you old lady?!&#8221; the twenty something said.</p>
<p>Still laughing, she said &#8220;I have grandkids and it&#8217;s all sprinkles with them!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting into a bad habit of staying up late. Late for me is past 11:00PM when I have to leave the house&nbsp;at 6:30am. It&#8217;s 11:30PM now. I&#8217;m gonna pay for this in the morning, and about an hour after eating lunch. I can&#8217;t wait for <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/FredMoody/moody18.html" target="">headset</a> monitors so I can sneak naps in while playing solitaire at work without getting caught.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week or two ago I went to the <a href="http://www.oakley.com/" target="">Oakley</a><p>&nbsp;friends and family sale. A buddie of mine does IT stuff there, and extended the invite. The sale was an <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/v03/index.htm?month=2001-11#100000" target="">adventure</a> in itself, which Erik summed up pretty good.</p><br />
<p>During the purchasing process of the sale, something happened. I can&#8217;t say for sure how or where it happened, but somewhere in the process two pairs of sunglasses I had picked out got switched with some awful pairs. There was a point where everything I had selected to purchase was handled rapidly by a team of &#8220;deboxers&#8221; who removed anything that would make it easy to try and return these goods to a retail outlet. This is where I think it happened.</p><br />
<p>I thought I was screwed, but I decided to try and talk to someone at Oakley directly. I&nbsp;emailed a guy named Bob&nbsp;who had run the huge parking lot sale, and the next day he left a voicemail saying he&#8217;d take care of everything. Fantastic! I listened to the voicemail, and like a full on idiot erased the message by mistake. Now I was gonna have to look like a dummy and email him again.</p><br />
<p>Well, he called me again this morning, this time I picked up, and we arranged to have the glasses exchanged tomorrow.</p><br />
<p>I am truly impressed with Oakley. The attention they&#8217;ve given me goes above and beyond what is required. At the sale, there were signs plastered everywhere saying &#8220;<span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">SALES</span> <span class="caps">FINAL</span>, NO <span class="caps">RETURNS</span>&#8221;. They don&#8217;t need to treat me this good.&nbsp;Very impressed with Oakley.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I jump around from computer to computer I often lose track of good sites that I come across because I either save the bookmark to a particular computer or just forget it entirely. If it wasn&#8217;t for some code I wrote a long time ago that stores URL&#8217;s found in my news entries, I&#8217;d probably forget about this <a target="" href="http://www2.wind.ne.jp/maniackers/designfont.html">cool font site</a> <p>I just discovered.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about making a web based bookmarks site, but there&#8217;s a lot of competition, and quite frankly I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to keep a project like that running smooth. I will continue to tinker with my personal web based bookmark tool, and if it ever gets so fancy that&nbsp;it would be a shame not to make it public, then I&#8217;ll open it up. If enough people bug me about it between now and then, I might be more motivated to finish it too.</p></p>

I don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s on the site yet, I got so excited when I saw it that I had to run over here and post it to share with the world my new find!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a site of photographs taken by someone during the <span class="caps">WTC</span> attacks through <a href="http://www.kottke.org">www.kottke.org</a> which I think are pretty interesting. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thomas_hobbs/pics/wtc/index.html" target="">Thomas Hobbs</a> took pictures from a different perspective than I&#8217;ve typically seen, mostly of people reacting to the attack. It amazes me that in some pictures there are crowds of people shoulder to shoulder in the street looking towards the towers. Sometimes in the past few months I&#8217;ve wished I were there so I could have seen it first hand, and could have taken pictures and given my own perspective on the event, but after letting it all sink in, and after getting a bigger picture of what happened, I&#8217;m glad I was safe at home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So conservative Christians are calling the new Harry Potter movie a work of the devil, suggesting that watching it turns people on to the occult because of it&#8217;s depiction of sorcery and witchcraft.</p>
<p>These same people probably saw Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and other similar Disney movies where there is almost always a wicked witch who has the capability of casting some type of crazy spell. Heck, in Snow White, the witch summons some crazy dragon/demon thing that seems to come straight from hell itself.</p>
<p>So if these same people had their fill of Disney movies, then by their own definitions they should be followers of Satan themselves, as they themselves have be exposed to the very occultish stuff they protest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An interesting thing happened yesterday. My wife got a call from a collection agency saying we owed Sprint $481.00 for an old Price.com cell phone account. They were obviously barking up the wrong tree considering the bill in question was for a fairly recent period, and I left Price.com at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>First I called the collection agency&nbsp;and told the guy who called me wife that I wasn&#8217;t happy with the way he treated my wife. I did the typical &#8220;Hi, if I talk like I might know you you won&#8217;t hang up on me&#8221; which he was pretty defensive about. I also in no uncertain terms told him he could shove it.</p>
<p>I called up Sprint, told them I wasn&#8217;t going to pay the bill because it wasn&#8217;t my responsibility, and they wiped it clean. They said &#8220;This is screwy, we&#8217;re wiping this clean, we&#8217;d spend more money trying to figure this all out than we&#8217;d end up getting from it&#8221;. I never once thought that Sprint could act like a smart business and I&#8217;m just happy that little fiasco was over as soon as it started.</p>
