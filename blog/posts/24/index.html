  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> has decided to take the plunge and make his weblog his profession. And he&#8217;s looking to support himself entirely on donations from his readers and not put a single ad up.</p>
<p>Having read Jason&#8217;s site for over six years now there was little question in my mind that I&#8217;d be contributing. I think I&#8217;ve probably looked at his site nearly every day in those six years and am rarely disappointed. Jason&#8217;s site was also the first weblog I&#8217;d recognized as a weblog and helped me direct the format of my own site over time. There&#8217;s no question that Jason has influenced blogging in a positive way and has asked for very little in return.</p>
<p>I can also empathize with Jason. I know what it&#8217;s like to ask your site visitors to help support something and that in itself isn&#8217;t easy. Combine that with the prospect of knowing you need real money to keep something alive, and the pressure is on. Grovel or give up. I have a feeling Jason won&#8217;t need to do as much grovelling as I did.</p>

It&#8217;s a light meter for photography from the fifties and it&#8217;s fully functional. Cost me $12.00 total. Modern light meters can be had for $250-400 for standard ones, more for super good ones.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a light sensor on the top (behind the little trap door thing) that collects the light. This then moves the little red needle which points to f-stops. The bigger, gear-like, dial is twisted so that the number displayed in the meter lines up with the &#8220;Open&#8221; mark (because I have the trap door open). The smaller dial is set to my film speed. I then have the proper shutter speed matched to the possible f-stops and I&#8217;m on my way to a perfectly exposed shot.</p>
<p>The meter is very small too. Truly pocket sized. It doesn&#8217;t take any batteries and comes with a tiny leather case. Sweet deal!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week since the site launched, and as promised I&#8217;ve put together a status report.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<strong>Incredible Traffic</strong><br />
<br />Immediately after launching the site <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> linked to it. Then <a href="http://www.waxy.org/">Andy</a>. And while those two alone produced some respectable numbers, it wasn&#8217;t until Wednesday when the traffic to my announcement really started picking up with a mention from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/08/blog_subjectmatter_d.html">BoingBoing</a>. On Thursday there was a dip as it moved down in the BoingBoing queue, but on Wednesday the mother of all traffic producers,  <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/11/0333219&amp;tid=98&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=149">Slashdot</a>, picked it up. Check out the graph below, and while you&#8217;re at it, note that I&#8217;m not quoting any specific numbers of any kind. I&#8217;ve done this expressly because of all the crazies that contacted me about things like $100 keywords and such. It&#8217;s stunning how many people are willing to pay for information about where to find the best keywords, and I don&#8217;t want to fuel that any further by putting any specific numbers on anything.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<img src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/images/traffic_rep.jpg" height="211" width="537" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Traffic Rep" /><br />
<br /><strong><br />
<br /></strong>Notice the last blip on the radar &#8211; this is where Google has started sending in traffic. Despite my serious amount of anxiety when both BoingBoing and Slashdot linked to my announcement, knowing that ultimately this would benefit page rank countered whatever negatives came from all that traffic (yes, negatives &#8211; read on). And in the end, a combination of page rank, relevant and useful content, and people who are interested in that content is what I&#8217;m looking for. I have a few of the pieces to that puzzle &#8211; it turns out that generating useful content is still the most difficult part. <strong>
<p></p><p><br />
</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<strong>The Downside to Massive Exposure<br />
<br /></strong>Getting a lot of traffic quickly typically means servers crash and bandwidth budgets get eaten up, but thankfully I was prepared to weather the storm in that department. I also expected a certain amount of support from people as well as crazies. The crazies email me with things like &#8220;Your cat eats asbestos&#8221; and &#8220;why hasn&#8217;t your server crashed yet?&#8221;, both of which are completely benign to me; I&#8217;ve been &#8220;exposed&#8221; to the Internet for long enough to know that a certain fixed percentage of people with keyboards are completely nuts, especially if they&#8217;re coming from Slashdot.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Also, there was a lot of negative stuff, most of which I can handle. Some of the laughable comments on Slashdot included things like &#8220;he&#8217;s driving up the cost of health care&#8221; or &#8220;he&#8217;s ruining weblogs&#8221;. A lot of people just didn&#8217;t seem to get it &#8211; they assumed that I was trying some new angle on spam, or that I was some kind of crook for wanting to make a profit.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Then there&#8217;s the whole Google thing. I fully expect that Google will keep anything I &#8220;earned&#8221; over the course of last week on Asbestos Blog, for good reason. The clicks received on Asbestos Blog were nearly entirely driven by visitors from Slashdot or BoingBoing. Note in the graph above that Google didn&#8217;t start sending me traffic until the very end. This would suggest that the clicks weren&#8217;t from people interested in anything related to asbestos, but were from people interested in seeing what would happen. I wouldn&#8217;t blame them if they kept the money. If they cut me from the program entirely, that&#8217;s not going to be pleasant. I&#8217;ve been running digitalslr.org for over a year now with Adsense ads, and it makes a fair amount of income that I&#8217;m not interested in seeing go away.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<strong>The Good Things</strong><br />
<br />I&#8217;ve met some very interesting people through the exposure so far. A father who&#8217;s two year old daughter has leukemia contacted me with a question about how he could setup something similar for leukemia. He and people he knows through his support groups will be able to post content relevant to something he&#8217;s been forced to become an expert on. I plan on helping him launch it as a resource, and of course allow him to capture any revenue from ads on it.<br />
<br /><strong><br />
<br />Summary</strong><br />
<br />I plan to keep the project going. A friend is putting together a visual face lift, and eventually I&#8217;ll provide a resources section that points people to resources that I think are helpful. Maybe eventually I&#8217;ll expand into another keyword and try to repeat whatever level of success, if any, Asbestos Blog has to offer. Right now, it&#8217;s simply still too early to tell.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday Carrie and the kids went to the zoo. Later that night, I asked Leah about the zoo, and I&#8217;ll quote, as accurately as possible, what she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a giraffe and it peed. It just peed right on the floor. It didn&#8217;t even have a toilet. And its tail broke. Its tail broke and it peed right on the floor!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the entire comment is funny by itself. The fact there&#8217;s this little human being who couldn&#8217;t construct a sentence mere months ago is now laughing about how an animal didn&#8217;t even use a toilet. It&#8217;s the last part that troubled me. I probed with &#8220;Its tail broke?&#8221; and she was emphatic. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s tail broke! It peed and its tail broke!&#8221;</p>
<p>I figured it out pretty quickly. This giraffe must have also pooped. To a 2 year old, this must look exactly like the tail of the animal breaking off and landing on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, its tail broke. You know what, I think maybe you saw the giraffe go poop. What you saw was the giraffe poop falling to the floor. He still has his tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right. He pooped! And he peed right on the floor without even using a toilet!&#8221;</p>
<p>She repeated her observations later that night to Carrie as we were getting her ready for bed. We laughed again, because she still thought the giraffe had broken its tail. But Carrie mentioned that she was pretty sure the giraffe didn&#8217;t do any of that while they were watching it at the zoo. Then we realized where Leah was getting this.</p>
<p>The night before we were watching a Nature episode on <span class="caps">PBS</span>, and a giraffe gave birth. Giraffes give birth standing up, and of course the baby just sort of falls right out on the ground, and is splashed by the afterbirth. Leah watched the entire episode with intensity, but hardly said a word, except for when the giraffe gave birth. She exclaimed at that point that the giraffe peed, but there nothing about any tails breaking.</p>
<p>Overnight she must have formed the tail breaking theory. It struck me after putting her down for the night that, inadvertently, I had impressed upon Leah&#8217;s plastic mind that giraffes poop out smaller giraffes and pee all over the floor without a toilet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doomed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started something different today. I launched <a href="http://asbestos.stinkmachine.com/">Asbestos News</a>. Like I said, something different.</p>
<p>The subject matter, while weighty and all that, is of little importance to me. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have opinions on asbestos and asbestos reform, because I do. The whole point of the site is to experiment with an idea. I built a tool that helps me aggregate topical news with the help of Google&#8217;s Alert system. So far it works wonderfully.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a second motive as well. Right now asbestos reform and asbestos related litigation is on fire. Lawyers are paying anywhere from $15-100 per click through on Google ads. The second part of this big experiment is to see if I can capture some of that click through revenue while still providing a somewhat valid service to people who might arrive by search results.</p>
<p>I say somewhat valid, because despite the fact that I read every article and summarize the article in every blog entry, the speed at which it all happens seems too good to be true. Quite literally, the current 20 or so articles on the site took me about an hour of cumulative time to produce. Granted, I&#8217;m making it easier on my self by allowing Google to tell me where the news is, but that&#8217;s the point of their service right? Also, I&#8217;m not expert. But over the course of just 20 blog entries, I might know more than the average Joe about asbestos.</p>
<p>I suspect that if Asbestos News does well, I&#8217;ll probably try to find another hotbed topic to blog on, and will continue to spawn what I&#8217;ll call, with trepidation, &#8220;topical news aggregator blogs&#8221; until the concept stops working.</p>
<p>I already take a much more personal approach with digitalslr.org and as far as advertising revenue goes it does fairly well compared to my original expectations. If I can emulate its success while doing less to get there, that&#8217;s what I call a good thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A group of artists is picking up thrift store artwork and <a href="http://thewurstgallery.com/vintage_vandals.html">improving</a> it. I almost put improving in double quotes to suggest that &#8220;improving&#8221; is in the eye of the beholder, but changed my mind because the original artwork is genuinely horrible.</p>
<p>I love the idea. I think it&#8217;s fantastic. I almost want to quit work and go pick up some so I can join in the fun.</p>
<p>When I start an illustration, the surface I&#8217;m painting on is often more important to me than the painting itself &#8211; or at the very least, it accounts for about 50% of the piece as a whole. Some of the old weathered pieces of crap artwork you&#8217;d find in a thrift store simply can&#8217;t be reproduced and would make great bases to start on, even if just for a beat up cheap frame.</p>
<p>Carrie and I are going to be doing illustrations tonight for <a href="http://www.illustrationfriday.com/">Illustration Friday</a> so I think one of us will need to make a quick trip to Goodwill for some base media.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why, in the year 2005 where robots do everything from clean floors to mow lawns and give haircuts, can&#8217;t I get a robot to do my laundry?</p>
<p>I could make it easy on the robot. I&#8217;ll wear all darks, head to toe and use a single bin with a radio homing beacon on it. The robot could home in on that, grab the bin, then listen for the washing machine beacon, and go dump the clothes in. That&#8217;s easy stuff if everything is designed correctly.</p>
<p>Step things up a bit in sophistication and have the robot tell the washing machine what kind of cycles should happen based on the bin it&#8217;s carrying (whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;darks&#8221; bin or &#8220;lights&#8221; or &#8220;fancy underpants&#8221; bin).</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t be that hard, but I recognize I&#8217;d be going too far if I expected the robot to put the clothing on me. But if it could, I&#8217;d be tickled.</p>
<p>So instead of waiting around for it, I have a simpler idea. The whole point is to come as close to not lifting a finger to wash clothes right? So purchase a bay of <a href="http://us.lge.com/Product/proddetail.do?actCategory=home&amp;archivedYn=&amp;actType=search&amp;categoryId=0000030203&amp;prodId=1000000048&amp;parentId=0000000302&amp;parent2levelId=0000000003&amp;category_level=4&amp;totalItem=3&amp;currentPage=1&amp;perPage=10">washer/dryer</a> units that wash and dry in the same bin. At least two, but I&#8217;m thinking four to ten would be ideal. Label one &#8220;darks&#8221;, the other &#8220;whites&#8221;, and just avoid all the middle men. Use the washers as both dirty clothes hampers and clothing storage.</p>
<p>Done with your clothes? Put them in the <span class="caps">ASSRAD</span> (automated super surfactant renewal array device). Need something fresh? Pull something out of your <span class="caps">ASSRAD</span>.</p>
