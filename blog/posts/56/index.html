  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work, I subscribe to a few email lists (<a href="http://lists.evolt.org/index.cfm/a/listinfo" target="_self">thelist</a> <p>at <a href="http://www.evolt.org" target="_self">evolt.org</a>) and some internal company ones. I use some rules within Outlook to move the incoming messages into their own folders, nice and tidy like so they don&#8217;t flood my inbox, and I purge anything over a week old to keep the emails from piling up.</p><br />
<p>This all works just fine, except that because my coworkers and I do a lot of emailing back and forth, I keep Outlook open all day, minimized in the background. Everytime I get an email, a little email icon shows up in my system tray, and I have to go check to see if my boss is emailing me something.</p><br />
<p>Most of the time, in fact I&#8217;d say 90% of the time, the new email is one of the email list messages, which I only read when I&#8217;m not swamped (which I am). So checking my email every two seconds is a serious pain, and I set out to fix it.</p><br />
<p>I found a tool called <a href="http://www.techhit.com/autoread/" target="_self">AutoRead</a> that&nbsp;you can download for Outlook that lets you control when the email icon shows up, and since I&#8217;ve been using it&nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed a serious productivity gain.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a jog in place contest. Whoever stops first gets to scrub both toilets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two minutes later I give up, telling myself it&#8217;s the noble thing to do. Let Carrie beat me at a jog in place contest, and save her from scrubbing the toilets.</p>
<p>But really, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m out of shape. It&#8217;s winter, and the last time I tried to go skateboarding I didn&#8217;t even get on the board and slipped and fell about five feet while judging the slickness of the skatepark.</p>
<p>I usually take pictures of my more significant wounds, but I was ashamed of this one because it wasn&#8217;t strictly a skateboarding accident, and honestly, I wasn&#8217;t thinking about how cool the wound looked, I was thinking about if I had ruptured some internal organs, and thinking about going to a hospital.</p>
<p>The wound made Carrie gag because you could see my fat through the gash. It was proof at least that there is indeed some fat on my body, or at that moment, peaking out. Most people would rush to the hospital, as I should have, but we have so little trust in our healthcare system that we feel our chances of recovering from a significant health incident are better by sticking around at home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all healed up now, but my calf muscles are screaming in soreness from the jog in place contest. This reminds me that before going down to California for Christmas, I better get in shape because my brothers and I will be hitting the local parks together.</p>

<p>What would it take for you to go to the hospital?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The guy in the cube next to me grunts a lot. He&#8217;ll be quiet for a while, and then, a series of grunts that would probably be appropriate in some place special other than his cube.</p>
<p>The lady in the cube behind me sings in between talking a lot on the phone. Her songs are mostly about Jesus.</p>
<p>The guy in the cube that I face sucks a lot of snot up into his head. I assume he was an orphan as a child, because most parents I know teach kids to blow their noses.</p>
<p>So I put the headphones on, because grunts make me laugh, and the man probably has an ulcer or something serious that shouldn&#8217;t be laughed at. And because I think that lines in peppy songs&nbsp;like &#8220;Jesus is my pal oh wow&#8221; are sacreligious. And because it digusts me to think of all the snot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in February of 2001, <a href="http://www.ekosm.com" target="_self">Erik</a> <p>and his wife Kathryn and Carrie and I took a trip to Oahu. It was something I was really looking forward to, because as a kid I was really into surfing and knew I&#8217;d be seeing the legendary spots. We were going in winter, when the wave sizes were usually at their peak (which, in hindsight, may be a total myth fabricated by little Californian grommets used to large winter waves every year).</p><br />
<p>Waimea, known for some of the biggest, craziest waves in the world, looked like this (apologies to Kathryn and her sandy cheeks, but this is my only shot of the water):</p><br />
<p><img height="267" alt="Nice cheeks" src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/images/DSCN2498.jpg" width="356" border="0" /></p><br />
<p>Notice how flat the ocean is. Like a placid country-side pond. I knew Waimea, just like any surf spot, would come up flat sometimes, so I wasn&#8217;t shattered and heartbroken to not see any massive waves. And Erik made the place forever memorable by running full blast down the beach towards the water, only to have his shorts fly off at the last second, tripping him up and throwing him headlong into a few feet of water. I was spared the moon, as I was already in the water, but the entire beach had all eyes on Erik from the start.</p><br />
<p>I found the following picture last week on filepile.org that I&#8217;m pretty sure might be Waimea, and I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s at least North Shore Oahu. The quality sucks because I&#8217;ve resized it with an awful photo editing tool (I&#8217;ll likely use Photoshop tonight to fix it), but the photo gives a really good idea of how incredibly massive these waves can get:</p><br />
<p><img height="284" alt="Wow!" src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/images/Hawaii1126sm.jpg" width="425" border="0" /></p><br />
<p>I estimate this wave to be more than thirty feet tall if measuring the face. The only way to catch a wave like this is to be towed in by a Waverunner. I can&#8217;t think of any sport that&#8217;s more extreme than what this guy is doing.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=360#comments" target="_self"><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think that the news* is corrupting my mind, competing for brain cycles that could otherwise be used for more important things, like trigonometry.</p>
<p>*News meaning sources of information like <span class="caps">CNN</span>, local television news, etc. News does not include Slashdot or other blogs, because they&#8217;re really sites that carry metadata on the news itself. Viewing these sites is likely to be considered cheating, which is something I can live with. As a compromise, I&#8217;ll make sure to skip past the mainstream news on Slashdot, and anything <span class="caps">DMCA</span> related (because it makes my blood boil). I will only look at pure, separated from the world, only-important-to-geek news of the kind that usually inspires me to be more geeklike.</p>
<p>The whole thing about news from sources like <span class="caps">CNN</span> for me is that it&#8217;s pretty mindless. It grabs my attention long enough to distract me, but only leaves me with weird little pointless facts. That combined with the fact that I never dig much deeper into the story makes it pretty pointless, and a waste of energy.</p>
<p>It all started after 9/11 when I was glued to at least two news sources at once, getting ready to don my gas mask the second <span class="caps">CNN</span> told me to. Ever since then, checking <span class="caps">CNN</span> has been an annoying ritual which stops now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly three years ago, little Elian inspired one of the best CDs ever, the &#8220;Save Elian&#8221; benefit CD. Inspiring songs like &#8220;Save Elian&#8221; and &#8220;He wanted to come here&#8221; and &#8220;Janet Reno is the Boogie Man&#8221; made that CD one to remember. So inspiring, and so worthwhile was this CD that you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to ever find it in stores or on Amazon.</p>
<p>To mark this special day, another <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/South/11/26/cuban.boy/index.html" target="_self">Cuban boy has come ashore</a><p>. But this time, his Mom is in Cuba, not his dad. Let the fun begin, again.</p><br />
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I got some nudges for making light of the whole Elian debacle. For the record, I have no opinion of Elian right now. But, I can say that someone made a very entertaining CD as mentioned above.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=358#comments" target="_self"><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&#8220;If we have access immediately to a site the credibility of our conclusion if we find nothing there is far higher than if there is any notice, even of one or two hours&#8221; - </em><p>Jacques Baute in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/11/26/iraq.inspectors/index.html" target="_self">this <span class="caps">CNN</span> Article</a></p><br />
<p>One would conclude from this statement by Jacque, the head of <span class="caps">UNMOVIC</span> (the inspectors) that if Iraq <em>did</em> have an extra hour or two before an inspection, that they&#8217;d be able to more easily conceal what the inspectors were looking for.</p><br />
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but as far as I know, the inspectors aren&#8217;t invisible, and when a team of seventeen people in marked UN vehicles starts rolling, every Saddham loving Iraqi is going to be reporting the movements of that circus. If a mind-melting chemical factory even suspects that an inspection might occur soon, they&#8217;ll have plenty of time to prepare. If you&#8217;re an inspection team, and you want &#8220;surprise&#8221; visits, you&#8217;re going to have to get pretty random, and being pretty random means going from one factory in one corner of the country, then another one, preferably not right next door. But that means you&#8217;ve got to travel, increasing the odds that the next factory you&#8217;ll be visiting will have known about&nbsp;your arrival&nbsp;for several hours. And obviously, if you just go from one factory to the next nearest factory, the next nearest factory will know what&#8217;s up, and force the factory workers to consume sensitive documents for lunch.</p><br />
<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d want a team at each site at the exact same time, ready to inspect at any second, but, there&#8217;s one more problem that further makes the leader of this UN Inspections team look like a real genious: Iraq has had months to prepare for inspections, in fact, I&#8217;d argue that they&#8217;ve had years. For all we know, they&#8217;re cooking up bioweapons in in baby diapers, and have been preparing for the inevitability of inspections all along.</p><br />
<p>Good luck Jacque.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, so beneath the slick <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/" target="_self">Art Center</a> <a href="http://www.chiatday.com/LosAngeles/index.html" target="_self">Alumni</a> <p>designed Apple sugary design is a real computer, with real computer issues, which I shall detail in short order, but first, as required by tangential laws, I must explain a current annoyance.</p><br />
<p>I hate typing lately. My fingers are tired, to the point where the above paragraph wasn&#8217;t a comfortable one. But the reason it&#8217;s not comfortable is simple. I type 40-50wpm with my two index fingers. It&#8217;s true. I never really cared or noticed before, but quite literally, I use only index fingers when it comes to typing letters, and it&#8217;s starting to wear down my hands. Who knows how long I&#8217;ve been doing this &#8211; I learned home row&nbsp;typing in <a href="http://www.marinavikings.org/" target="_self">high</a> <a href="http://www.marinavikings.org/" target="_sefl">school</a>, and liked it just fine. Somewhere in the past ten years I&#8217;ve gotten lost, and have perverted those skills.</p><br />
<p>So, in an effort to save my hands, it&#8217;s all home row or nothing at all, but my typing speed has dropped while my error count has skyrocketed. It will all pay off in the end.</p><br />
<p>Back to the Mac. The 17&quot; iMac is not a pansy machine. It has a fast processor, a ton of memory, and a rocket fast video card. With that in mind, I installed <a href="http://www.aspyr.com/mini-sites/medal/" target="_self">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> so I could continue my current World War II obsession, brought on by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380973464/michaelbuffin-20" target="_self">Cryptonomicon</a> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-author%3DStephenson%2C%20Neal/ref%3Dase%5Fmichaelbuffin-20" target="_self">Neal Stephenson</a>.</p><br />
<p>Highly dissappointed. This game was only midly playable with the resolution set so the pixels were nearly the size of postage stamps, and the details set to what I&#8217;ve dubbed LegoMode. With the same video card chipset on almost any PC, this game would scream. Something about the iMac, or the way this game was ported to the Mac is seriously messed up.</p><br />
<p>Also, I love the concept of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/" target="_self">iCal</a> software. It provides an elegant and well designed way of viewing upcoming events and schedules and such. The problems: it seems very slow and sluggish. Entering a calendar event is very cumbersome, and feels incredibly slow. And, there&#8217;s no way of exporting the data to another program. Heck, even <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/entouragex/default.asp?navindex=s4" target="_self">Microsoft Entourage</a> makes this easy on the Mac. And, I can import from any other calender program into iCal. I suspect that iCal is a marketing vehicle for Apple, used to help sell their <a href="http://www.mac.com/" target="_self">.Mac</a> accounts. If you have one of these accounts, it becomes easier to share your calendar with others, but it is unknown whether having an account makes it easier to share with other programs.</p><br />
<p>I still think the new Mac in our family which has yet to earn a nick name is still hot stuff. I spent a great deal of time on it this weekend, and have learned that it could easily replace my Windows based machines.</p></p>
