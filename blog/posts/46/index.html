  <div class="entry-content"><p>My stepdad, sister and her boyfriend arrived for a visit on Friday, and we&#8217;ve been right tourists since, showing them how we&#8217;ve been living and spending time seeing the sights. It&#8217;s been busy, so a quick summary:</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>
<p>Spent most of the day floating down the Thames on a hired motorboat. This was very enjoyable, as I&#8217;m fond of anything that moves by harnessing the power of combustion or any other power for that matter. Seeing England from the river instead of the motorway is very different, and certainly more peaceful, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d really like to do again. It was my first time piloting a boat, and I felt like quite the Captain of my ship.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>
<p>Trained it into London again and visited Camden Market, the London Eye, Speakers Corners, and did a lot of Underground travel. Got completely knackered after jumping on some combination trampoline/bungee jump device in front of the Saatchi. Still sore today.</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong></p>
<p>Drove out to the Cotswolds to see some quaint English villages.&nbsp;Stopped in one called Bilbury where the ducks were&nbsp;so hungry they were literally trying to eat us. Kip picked up a duck.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong></p>
<p>Carrie and I drove out to Henley on Thames, and on the way back found a backroad out into the hills where we found a green field with far too many flies to be normal. We quickly vacated, and didn&#8217;t do much more until dinner, where Carrie ate a sea bass at a nice Thai place on the river.</p>
<p>We have photos of all of this, but there&#8217;s some work that needs to be done on the photo album software, so they&#8217;ll have to wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Orin Hatch wants to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/06/18/download.music.ap/index.html" target="">blow up your computer</a><p>. With bombs.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m going to attempt to recreate the general thoughts behind why Orin wants to do this in few different ways, and then I&#8217;m going to do my utter best to trash the idea until I sound like a fanatic. It&#8217;s mighty presumptious of me to do this, but the man has asked for it.</p><br />
<p><strong>The I&#8217;m With Stupid Theory</strong></p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;The industry doesn&#8217;t like this whole being able to download music thing, so it&#8217;s my duty as a sworn civil servant to protect the <span class="caps">RIAA</span>, because they know exactly what the customer wants. I will create a bomb that punishes citizens for bad behavior. No need for the judicial system here, this is the wild untamable Internet.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>The problem is, the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> doesn&#8217;t have a clue what the customer really wants. They stick to the ways they&#8217;ve always done things because they&#8217;re deathly afraid of losing grip of something they shouldn&#8217;t have so much control over in the first place.</p><br />
<p><strong>End of Strife and Suffering Theory</strong></p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;Downloading music from the Internet is bleeding the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> dry. As a sworn civil servant, I must protect the industry. I will create a bomb, etc.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>Record sales have continued to climb despite the millions of people downloading songs without paying for them. Would it be any different if file trading never happened? Who can say, but the point is, the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> isn&#8217;t hurting by any means. Sure there&#8217;s an argument that if there were no file trading they might be making more money, but thatâ€™s not the point here. The point is, I&#8217;ve made up some stuff that Orin Hatch might have thought, and then critisized him for what I made him think.</p><br />
<p><strong>Uncontrolled File Trading is Bad Theory</strong></p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s no accounting for all of this trading. The industry can&#8217;t get a handle for what their customers like because it&#8217;s untamed. There&#8217;s no control. So I shall build a bomb, etc.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>If you have no affilliation with the <span class="caps">RIAA</span>, and you&#8217;re an independent musician, uncontrolled file trading can create a windfall of opportunity. I&#8217;m convinced that some of the savvier PR companies affiliated with the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> actually dump a few singles of the artists that they also have showing up on variety shows to help promote album sales. It is a good tool for that. It&#8217;s radio on demand in a sense, without the ads (which I&#8217;d venture to guess the PR companies wouldn&#8217;t mind losing).</p><br />
<p>The most disturbing thing from Orin&#8217;s new viewpoint is that he&#8217;s suggesting creating some kind of mechanism that causes destruction of data and possible damages hardware. Hackers go to jail for this kind of thing, and often serve more time than rapists and murderers.</p><br />
<p>Also disturbing &#8211; what about the judicial system? Why would the government, or scarier still, the <span class="caps">RIAA</span>, be able to break hacking type laws to deal out punishment to people who at worst download something that ultimately serves to support the very industry that is freaked out by the action in the first place?</p><br />
<p>It sounds like I&#8217;m making a big deal out of nothing, but for a politician to be able to suggest that punishment can be dealt automatically for a crime, circumventing all checks and balances in the judicial system, scares me. Taken to an extreme, if you could automatically deal out capital punishment for murder, wouldn&#8217;t that be scary?</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m so happy to have found the notebooks of <a href="http://osulibrary.orst.edu/specialcollections/rnb/" target="">Linus Pauling</a><p>. Over 72 years of research notes and personal musings of a guy who spent all sorts of time thinking about all sorts of things. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to get too deep into them, but it looks like good stuff. Any guy who can go about thinking about theories of metal to hairless mice within two entries has my vote as a smarty pants.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Baby + Stroller + Perfect Summer Like Temperature + London = Slow Moving.</p>
<p>Today we went into London without a goal or a plan. Bad idea. Someone somewhere must have issued some kind of decree, saying &#8220;If you are in any way capable of getting yourself into London on or in some sort of transportation, or even not, you must do it or you&#8217;ll be locked in the stocks and we&#8217;ll make you eat spotted dick until you&#8217;re sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so everyone was there, and we had no plan. We, or rather I, just wanted to get into town and take advantage of the nice weather. We got out of the house by 13:00, onto a train by 13:33, and to South Kensington by 14:30. Slow. We found a corner cafe even through a starved daze, and spent the next 2 hours waiting for food, eating food, waiting for the bill, then finding out that no Visa would be accepted there. I footed it to a bank, got some cash, waited for change, and we were off to Speakers Corner in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>It was hard to comprehend what was going on as throngs of people surrounded people yelling about Jesus. The most convincing &#8220;speaker&#8221; was a group of gospel singers. Had a good time watching them, but then the heat drove us into shadier parts. We spent about an hour watching a guy learning how to rollerblade, laughing, racked with guilt, as he fell a few times.</p>
<p>From there we walked straight to the station, and we were home by 20:00. Total time spent travelling:&nbsp;4 hours. Eating: 2 hours. Enjoying London: 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson:</strong> <p>if you have an eight month old who is devouring every new and exciting experience while trying to walk/crawl/scoot, and you want to depend on public transportation you must&nbsp;plan out every move. Know exactly when she has to eat, what time the train comes, where you&#8217;re going to eat, and where you&#8217;re going to&nbsp;tie your shoes. Never expect it to be as easy as just two adults moving quickly. It never will be.</p><br />
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, being parents is rewarding, but it&#8217;s certainly not free of difficulties. We&#8217;ve learned, and next time, we&#8217;ll be prepared.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, I&#8217;m no Don Johnson. But I know freaky people when I see them. We had a carnival in our little English country-side town today, and I&#8217;ll be darned if I didn&#8217;t see some of the most whacked out people I think I&#8217;ve ever seen. I should be struck down with a bolt of lightening for even noticing, but you weren&#8217;t there. If you were, you&#8217;d think the same thing and you&#8217;d feel just as guilty as me.</p>
<p>My theory: in America, ugly whacked out people with teeth sticking out of their foreheads are shamed into staying indoors. English people simply have no shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t get my mind off the Mini. They&#8217;re everywhere in the UK, and the newest ones are very attractive. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the <a href="http://www.miniusa.com" target="">Mini <span class="caps">USA</span></a> <p>site is well done either. Carrie and I are going to arrange a tour to go see Mini&#8217;s being made, we are both so into the idea of a Mini. I&#8217;ll have to leave the checkbook at home because I&#8217;m just about sold on one, and I have yet to even&nbsp;drive one.</p><br />
<p>If I get one, I won&#8217;t settle for anything less than the full deal. Heated seats, panoramic sun roof. Leather. Voice guided, <span class="caps">GPS</span> aided, <span class="caps">DVD</span> driven navigation system. There&#8217;s no point in getting such a lovely little machine unless it&#8217;s well appointed, and overall, the payments don&#8217;t change all that much over 60 months. The one add on that kicks the payments up a bit is the kit that brings the horsepower up to 200hp. That one may be hard to justify, but if you&#8217;re into selling Mini&#8217;s in the Maidenhead, Berks UK area, and you have one with the 200hp add-on kit, one test drive and you&#8217;ll probably have a sale.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ll even take a right drive one if we can get it back cheaply to the states. Paint the Union Jack on top, and I&#8217;ll be the envy of every Britophile in the states.</p><br />
<p>And while I&#8217;m drooling over the Mini I should also mention that I&#8217;m set on winning the lottery too. Odds are, my number will come up eventually, just as the odds are that a gopher will bore through the earth and chew my feet off as I write this. But when I win it, man, watch out, because here comes Michael in a Mini.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week I have literally worked 16-18 hours a day. At Xerox we&#8217;ve had 8 month projects going live, and at home I&#8217;ve had deadlines to meet on other projects as well.</p>
<p>The thing is, with all of the pressure and work, I find that my motivation levels seem to actually be increased. When work is slow, my mind is slow, and I don&#8217;t feel like getting stuff done. But when at any given second during the day I can pick from a multitude of tasks that need getting done, it seems there is no obstacle whatsoever.</p>
<p>The question is: do I enjoy it? I do, to a degree. When work is slow, I feel like I&#8217;m spinning out of control. If there&#8217;s nothing to occupy me, my idle mind starts to go bonkers. But there&#8217;s also a lot not to like. I miss my family, even though I go home to them every night. I&#8217;m seeing a lot less of Leah and Carrie than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;m tired. My body aches from something, either the lack of movement or being on my feet all day speaking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also experiencing England in a far different way than I would if I were on holiday. I&#8217;m living and working here, and while it&#8217;s the same in a lot of ways, it&#8217;s so much different as well. I had my first wave of homesickness last week, and while it passed, it almost hurt. If things get particularly stressful, or if home seems far away, I get little waves of it as well. Luckily, all will end up well, as I&#8217;ll only be here until mid August, and some of the franticness of going live will settle down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie is a <a href="http://www.gamehouse.com/gemdrop/" target="">Super Gem Drop</a> <p>champion, but she&#8217;s not yet fully convinced. I however am convinced that she can start bringing home the bacon by playing video games. Normally, I&#8217;m the champion when it comes to playing video games, and that&#8217;s mostly because I&#8217;m the only one in&nbsp; my house who plays. But Carrie&#8217;s sisters discovered Super Gem Drop and they leave me in their dust. The highest score I can get is 4 million&nbsp;or so (luck), and Carrie has now consistently got over 10 million (mad skill).</p><br />
<p>Incidentally, I really wish I had a Super Gem Drop type of game on my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html" target="">Nokia 3650</a>. If you know of a <span class="caps">MIDP</span> or J2ME game that would pass, <a href="comments.cfm?id=457" target="">let me know</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I thought I was shrinking. For real. I was walking from the Tesco&#8217;s Canteen (a supermarket cafeteria where the Mac &amp; Cheese is worth every pent) and as I was walking past a billboard, thought that I was for sure shrinking, rapidly. I yelped, then realized what was really happening.</p>
<p>But first, a disclaimer. I keep telling this story to people, and explaining myself to those who saw me duck and heard me&nbsp;yelp, and they don&#8217;t get it. It&#8217;s all a matter of cultural differences. Where I come from, there&#8217;s no such thing as a billboard in front of a store that suddenly, without warning, scrolls up and replaces it&#8217;s previous advert with a new one. It doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re standing next to one, and entire view and peripheral view is consumed by this, and it goes and does it&#8217;s thing, you think &#8220;good grief I&#8217;m surely going to shrink to the size of a mouse&#8221; and&nbsp;you yelp. You shriek because you think &#8220;this can&#8217;t be happening, how will I explain this to my wife?&#8221;. You don&#8217;t think &#8220;mechanical billboard&#8221; or &#8220;maybe I&#8217;m falling down&#8221; or &#8220;maybe that billboard is taking flight&#8221;. You think &#8220;I&#8217;m shrinking, rapidly&#8221;.</p>
<p>Consider peoples&nbsp;in far off tribes like in Africa or South America or somewhere who may have never seen or heard of something as crazy as say a car or a TV. Everyday objects to us, but totally mysterious and crazy magical items to those who&#8217;ve never seen or experienced them. Do we think they&#8217;re stupid when they look at the back of the TV to see how we fit people inside? When they cower in fear because they&nbsp;think we&#8217;ve trapped lions under the hood of the car? Heck no! We just call them inexperienced.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it.</p>
