  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been neglecting the site because I&#8217;ve been so busy in other areas. With a big code rollout at work, a  conference to prepare for, and a big plumbing project, I&#8217;ve had little time to devote towards writing things.</p>
<p>In brief, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<p>Carrie and I are currently hooked on The Amazing Race 5. Utterly hooked. In that same vein, excitement for Survivor is building.</p>
<p>I complained to <span class="caps">UPS</span> about how fast their drivers go down my street. I saw one go by doing about fifty just now, and kids play on our street. Not cool. The person who answered my complaint asked that I get both the license plate number and the truck number, both located on separate parts of the truck. I could only laugh, and said something like &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding. They&#8217;re doing 50mph around a blind corner, and you want me to gather at least 10 alphanumeric characters off as it flashes by.&#8221; The person (I say person because a.) I don&#8217;t know what you call people who answer complains and b.) I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was a man or woman. Rocky is a fairly ambiguous name, and even more so when the voice could be male or female). I&#8217;m worried that I&#8217;ll get broken stuff from <span class="caps">UPS</span> from now on though. The price I pay for neighborhood safety.</p>

I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that this is no longer something to say &#8220;haha, isn&#8217;t it funny, I hate getting haircuts&#8221; about. It&#8217;s a very real and most pure hatred of getting haircuts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joy is unmistakable when you&#8217;re drowning in it.</p>
<p>This morning I turned on The Shins, which is a band that has been getting the talk for a long time now, but is one that I&#8217;ve only just recently discovered.</p>
<p>As the strums of the rhythm guitar started the first song off, Leah came running into the room where I had it playing, planted her feet hard to stop herself from her newest mode of high velocity travel, and proclaimed that we must, as she put it, &#8220;<span class="caps">DANCE</span>!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we danced. She combined alternating foot stomping with an orbit while doing the wave with her arms. I emulated, though my orbit was in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Over the course of four songs, I was simply overwhelmed with joy. I knew that that was good, but that through our lives together it would happen again, and again, and again. I savor the idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.consolationchamps.com/">James</a> linked to <a href="http://go.sojo.net/campaign/takebackourfaith">this petition</a> that comes with a sort of manifesto that I think is very tactful in suggesting that Christians should vote on Christian values and ethics rather than simply vote Republican or Democratic, though is does subtly lean towards Kerry.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually get too deep into topics such as religion or politics, but this one struck a chord. I&#8217;ve literally been getting the shivers as I watch the <span class="caps">RNC</span> and I hear a politician suggest that our war against Iraq is both a fight against Islamic extremist terrorists and is backed by God and Christian values, then suggests that anyone against the war is also a terrorist.</p>
<p>I think it safe to say, based on what I know of Christian values, that Christ wouldn&#8217;t approve of America&#8217;s bravado in vanquishing our foe. Defending our country is one thing. Blowing a country to smithereens in a Shock and Awe campaign based on faulty intelligence is another thing entirely. Smugly trotting about, ignoring the international community, does not ring as Christ-like. Putting our country $1 Trillion in debt in order to drop bombs instead of using the same money for humanitarian aid doesn&#8217;t seem to agree either. Maltreatment, abuse, torture, however isolated, of human beings at prison camps is completely counter to what I know of Christian values.</p>
<p>And yet, there are supposed Christians protesting at the <span class="caps">RNC</span> with <a href="http://photos.tetto.org/march/?image=DSC_2060">signs like this</a> chock full of symbols representing war and destruction. I&#8217;d say that nearly 80% of the protest signs I&#8217;ve seen in support of the war mention something based in Christian values, and when our own President talks of the war he echoes those same Christian values.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the religious right currently, but at least I know that not all Christians believe the current administration is practicing Christian values. But I get the idea that some of those Islamic extremists our country would gladly eradicate probably see Christians to be as determined to encourage war as we feel the Islamic extremists are determined to wreak terror. I can&#8217;t help but feel like if our current administration were truly Christlike, there&#8217;d probably be far less animosity towards us by people of other faiths to begin with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you get on in life one of the things you realize is that you have no idea how it&#8217;s possible to come up with so many different varieties of cheese.</p>
<p>And then you start thinking about how good cheese is, but how wretched it would be if you&#8217;d never had it, and someone said &#8220;hey, this sort of fungus slash milk solid stuff is tasty, you should place it in your mouth and savor it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Astounding also is the idea that someone figured out how to make cheese in the first place. A little man in France with a bucket of freshly squeezed goats&#8217; milk climbed into a cave and did something with the milk that most people would consider incorrect (such as letting it rot or doing whatever it is to make it become cheese) [notice my lack of cheese production knowledge shining forth like a full moon out a car window].</p>
<p>In addition to everything else that&#8217;s puzzling about cheese, consider that it is one of the few things we eat that melts when heated. The only other things I can think of are sugary things, like caramel, chocolate, and things with very clear and defined origins. Melting milk based fungus solids on my Mexican food just sounds so wrong, but the mouth says it&#8217;s so right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I managed to get some plumbers to grovel under my house today. They fixed the problem we&#8217;ve been having in less than two hours, and charged a flat rate of $250.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I was told by the plumber who was supposed to originally come out that he couldn&#8217;t come for another two weeks. I heard the same story from pretty much every other plumber I called. All the rejection basically boiled over, and I resolved myself to fix the problem on my own.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of staring at the lattice work of <span class="caps">CPVC</span> under my house, I realized that while I might have been able to pull it off with the right tools and some patience, it would have likely taken me eight hours or more, and I&#8217;d be scared to death that it would leak again.</p>
<p>In desperation, I called a national plumbing service, and within an hour they had two plumbers at my door who gave me a set flat rate price quote of $280. Within two hours they&#8217;d pulled out the leaky pipe, and were testing the system. They wrote up an invoice for $250 because, in the end, it was a little less difficult than they thought it would be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased with the $250, even though at around $125/hr, they got there quickly, were professional, looked at some other problems I was having and gave me advice for other projects, cleaned up after they left, and most importantly, fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Stress level down from Ultra-Mega to Above Average now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been quite artful lately with my campaigning. My constituency (Carrie) has been a patient voter, and has accepted my stump speeches with equal portions skepticism and acceptance. At some point last week, I decided that plumbing the aquarium in our living to the garage would be a great idea (and it is, truly). I kept coming up with good reasons for it, all based on completely sound logic which you can <a href="http://www.cubereef.com/2004/08/remote_sump.html">read about</a> on a <a href="http://www.cubereef.com/">site</a> I&#8217;ve been keeping dedicated entirely to our living room aquarium.</p>
<p>But, despite all my best campaigning, I still had to convince myself that I could do the project, the first step of which meant that I&#8217;d need to get under the house and survey the situation.</p>
<p>The crawl space under our house is nasty, in fact, I might have reason to be concerned. The depths range from one foot to four or five feet, and the entire lumpiness of concrete footings and earth are covered in what appears to be a single sheet of plastic. Under that plastic you can hear water moving. In some places, water puddles on top of it. Surely this isn&#8217;t good, but I&#8217;m a trooper, and I survey the situation.</p>
<p>Running some pipe looks easy, except there&#8217;s the part where the pipe goes into the garage that looks tricky. I get out of the crawl space, and determine where in the garage the pipe can come in, and all is well. The next step is getting back down there and locating the aquarium to make sure there are no obstacles there. Right before going in, Carrie and I are standing in the kitchen and we realize that the floor where I&#8217;m standing is not only very warm, but bows up, and with every step I take, rises and falls. I agree to go look in that direction on my next trip into the underworld.</p>
<p>With my skateboarding knee pads on to avoid the absolute certainty of granite shards carrying all my weight exactly on my knee caps, I slither over a waste pipe, and under a soft (itchy) and fluffy (flesh rendering) thrust of insulation. As I shift into position, the flashlight I&#8217;m holding momentarily lights the area I&#8217;m heading, where it burns two disturbing images into my head.</p>
<p>1. Surprisingly, billowing clouds of steam under your house brings to mind Dante&#8217;s Inferno, both literally and figuratively. Instantaneously, you know that things aren&#8217;t looking good in that general direction, as descriptions of Hell don&#8217;t look so good. But also, you&#8217;re struck with the wooden plank of realization that your funds and a plumber are about to become well acquainted.</p>
<p>2. Water pouring out of a pipe underneath your house can never be good, unless your house is situated on the edge of a waterfall, and that kind of thing is normal. It can only be worse if that water appears to be melting the very ground it&#8217;s pouring onto, and collecting in a sub-abysmal lake beneath your family room where it stews and boils like the lake of fire and brimstone that it is.</p>
<p>In a panic, I pull myself out of the ground and call four plumbers in a row. I literally pace the entire floor of our house, puzzling over what to do next. I realize that the very costly water bill we had last month isn&#8217;t from turning on the sprinklers more often, and that it&#8217;s from the slowly forming sink pit under the house. I realize why it has been so difficult to cool the house lately, and why my electricity and gas bills have been up. I begin finding solace in the fact that at the very least, once the problem is fixed I&#8217;ll spend less money on utilities. Opening a portal to Hell, apparently, isn&#8217;t easy on the monthly bottom line.</p>
<p>Eventually, a plumber, and says he can come fix the problem on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning, depending on how the scheduled job he has is finished during the day on Monday. I turn of the water mains, inform the Carrie that we have three total flushes available to us, and that we better use them well, and we begin living like desert dwellers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried turning on a faucet eighteen times already.</p>
<p>I think while the plumber is down there, I may have him run the plumbing for my aquarium as well. In addition to all the scientific benefits and wonderful qualities that I&#8217;ve been ex<em>pounding</em> upon to Carrie, there&#8217;s the added benefit that if not for the idea of doing it, we&#8217;d probably be walking around the house in asbestos waders in a week.</p>
