<p>While the server is in transit, I&#8217;ll have a transitionary page up that gives detailed instructions on how to filet fish of all varieties. This way, the downtime will not be downtime at all, but will be a very rich and rewarding period of growth and learning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We drove to the Oregon coastline this weekend. The salt smell, crash of waves, and mist reminded me that I missed home, where the beach is minutes or blocks away, and is warm and familiar.</p>
<p>I almost made a huge mistake when coming to Oregon. At first, I didn&#8217;t want Carrie to come. I thought she&#8217;d be bored and homesick, and I wanted her to be with her family. When I was on the road alone&nbsp;in New Jersey, I was bored and homesick, and ached for family, and I didn&#8217;t want Carrie to have to experience that this time around.</p>
<p>Carrie came, and it seems that where she is, there also is home. Despite the brief reminders of the beaches in Southern California, Oregon feels like home. Had she stayed behind, I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;d be bored, homesick, and aching for home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the very dull <span class="caps">DMCA</span> post. It&#8217;s friday, time for a funny, self revealing story about myself.</p>
<p>I have mutual bathroom use issues. If I&#8217;m standing at a urinal, and someone else comes in, my body, without my encouragement, shuts off. This is annoying. I do not prefer using the restroom if others are present. There&#8217;s no reason really. It really cannot be understood.</p>
<p>I think it stems from my childhood. Once, as a small&nbsp;child,&nbsp;I was at a major league baseball game. The bathrooms had troughs for men to aim for, and as a little kid, this was a scary place. There&#8217;s nothing scarier than being a few feet tall amongst dozens of men peeing into a trough.</p>
<p>That also reminds of the time I went horseback riding in Mexico as a kid. The peso was very weak then, and it cost nearly $0.35 to ride a horse with a guide for the entire day. At the end of the ride, the horses lined up to eat their hay while everyone dismounted. It took me a little longer to get off the horse, and when I finally reached the ground, there were dozens of horse bladders being emptied in unison. Terrifying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re a geek, you probably remember when <a href="http://www.planetebook.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=170" target="_self">Dmitry Sklyarov </a><p>was <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/20444.html" target="_self">arrested</a> by the <span class="caps">FBI</span> immediately after giving a speech to fellow geeks at the DefCon 9, the ninth annual convention on computer security and other very geeky things. If not, then he probably means little to you, and you&#8217;re probably hitting the back button as we speak, but wait, this is important stuff.</p><br />
<p>What could Dmitry have said that would motivate the <span class="caps">FBI</span>? Dmitry demonstrated software that was able to read the popular <span class="caps">PDF</span> file format without using the Adobe Acrobat plugin. Seems pretty harmless right? He figured it all out on his own, without stealing anything from Adobe, and was excited to show it off. He didn&#8217;t sneak into Adobe, and take pictures of their secret business operations. No one has died by his hands, he&#8217;s a pretty harmless and well meaning geek. So why the arrest?</p><br />
<p>There&#8217;s this thing called the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html" target="_self"><span class="caps">DMCA</span></a>. <a href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html" target="_self">The Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a>. It was passed a few years back, and is basically 59 pages of&nbsp;copyright law&nbsp;that strip consumers of all sorts of rights, and give big producers of copywritten material all sorts of rights (enough in this case to have a man arrested and put in federal prison). In this case, Adobe felt that Dmitry was breaking the <span class="caps">DMCA</span>.</p><br />
<p>That was about a year ago. Currently, the US vs. Elcomsoft, Dmitry&#8217;s software company, case, has yet to happen.</p><br />
<p>Fast forward to today. <a href="http://perens.com/" target="_self">Bruce Perens</a>, a software developer, was making <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/07/23/020723hnperens.xml" target="_self">serious plans</a> to talk about how to &#8220;unlock&#8221; region encoded <span class="caps">DVD</span> discs at the Infoworld Convention tomorrow. He was sure that he was going to be breaking the <span class="caps">DMCA</span>, and was getting a lot of coverage because of his &#8220;screw you <span class="caps">DMCA</span>&#8221; attitude. Compare that to the attitude of Dmitri and you can guess what the <span class="caps">FBI</span> might do.</p><br />
<p><span class="caps">DVD</span> players currently disallow a viewer in America to watch a <span class="caps">DVD</span> from Japan. I can&#8217;t begin to tell you why this is, I don&#8217;t even know myself. Seems pretty pointless. Anyhow, this little &#8220;feature&#8221; of <span class="caps">DVD</span> players is a major annoyance, and ends up costing smaller <span class="caps">DVD</span> producers more money if they want to sell to markets outside their region. Big Hollywood has no problem with it, in fact, they suggested it in the first place, and are also largely responsible for the <span class="caps">DMCA</span> all together. Spending millions upon millions&nbsp;on lobbyists can produce desirable results.</p><br />
<p>Bruce has <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/3735855.htm" target="_self">changed his plans</a> however. It seems that Hewlett-Packard, a company with deep pockets, funds most of Bruce&#8217;s projects, and they feared that they&#8217;d get dragged into the inevitable bloody battle launched by Hollywood. They encouraged Bruce to avoid breaking the <span class="caps">DMCA</span>, and Bruce agreed willingly.</p><br />
<p>Personally, I think the <span class="caps">DMCA</span> is based on pure greed. It does little to protect me, both as a content producer and consumer, and does quite a bit to keep the money in big media&#8217;s pockets. The problem is, big media companies keep using the <span class="caps">DMCA</span> to fight the little guys, and they keep winning. It&#8217;s a big stupid mess, and the regular Joe on the street doesn&#8217;t know enough about what kind of freedoms are being stripped from them, and when they do, it will likely be too late to do anything about it.</p><br />
<p>The <span class="caps">DMCA</span> is getting people like Dmitry and others&nbsp;put in federal prison for what? Writing code? Code that perhaps makes big media companies uncomfortable? So a single coder is more dangerous than a giant corporation or consortium of giant corporations who are motivated by little more than greed?</p><br />
<p>The <span class="caps">DMCA</span> disgusts me, not so much because it&#8217;s a thorn in my side (truthfully, I doubt I&#8217;ve felt any discomfort from it yet). The <span class="caps">DMCA</span> to me represents Hollywood and the sickening wealth it generates, and it&#8217;s influence over the American justice system. It proves that, with enough money, Hollywood can influence law makers to pass laws that suit no one better but Hollywood itself, squashing even the slighest opposition to their making sickening amounts of money. Give Hollywood enough power and influence, and eventually our bank accounts will be charged everytime we listen to Barry Manilow, or catch a glimpse of Mel Gibson.</p><br />
<p>Simply disgusting.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep. I updated the stylesheet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started a new thing. I&#8217;ve always wanted archive old styles of the site, and I think I finally figured out a very simple way of doing it. The next step is to allow visitors to see the old styles. You can already check out the <a href="/mb/home.cfm?testStyle=basic.css" target="_self">previous style</a><p>, but there&#8217;s obviously some flaws in the design. I&#8217;ll write a nifty little piece of code that also changes the image to suit the archived color schemes, but not now. I&#8217;ve exceed my 15 minute monthly programming allocation for michaelbuffington.com.</p><br />
<p>For those curious, the image in the current style is a slice of a <a href="/php/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=album12&amp;id=aan/" target="_self">picture</a> I took of the Newberg Skatepark (well, officially the Chelhalem Skatepark, but more popularly known as Newberg), in Newberg Oregon.</p><br />
<p>Notice the photo album shows the old style. I liked the photo album at first, but now I&#8217;m not sure after spending literally hours trying to customize it. I&#8217;m not a stranger to <span class="caps">PHP</span>, but I&#8217;m also no expert. Hacking about in the gallery files is no fun.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in highschool my friends were bastards. I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time, but I suspect now, having a little more wisdom under my belt, that they weren&#8217;t really my friends at all, and that they liked the fact that I had a car. It wasn&#8217;t much of a car at the time, but it was better than skateboarding five or six blocks.</p>
<p>What likely made my situation worse was that I hated giving people rides. I was selfish with my car, to the point of being a bastard myself. I&#8217;ve decided over the years that this unwillingness to share was the source of a lot of their bastard like tendencies towards me. I can&#8217;t say I blame some of their actions, I&#8217;d do the same to me if I were them.</p>
<p>One night during the summer, we were all pretty bored. Having grown tired of launching water balloons out the window at joggers and dog walkers (yes, collectively we were all bastards), we&#8217;d thought of a new game.</p>
<p>We were going to play Army at the highschool when it got dark. Kevin (a borderline bastard) had done it before, and it was a lot of fun. I think the object was to team up, and then I&#8217;m not sure what, it didn&#8217;t really matter. Basic bored teenage male behavior.</p>
<p>We pulled up to the school, got out of the car and started to argue about teams and such, when the sky exploded into thunderous booms, and it began to hail like I&#8217;ve never seen before or since. The hail was like large marbles. Pretty big stuff, enough that it hurt like hell if you got hit right on the head.</p>
<p>It was fantastic running around in the hail, it was such a strange random event, that it made that boring summer night one to always remember.</p>
<p>While I was revelling in the strange weather event, one of the most bastard-like of my friends began to flip out. He turned on me, upset that we had &#8220;Arrived too late&#8221; to play our game, and that it was my fault for driving. I knew then he was a bastard, but I&#8217;ve since thought of that night, and suspect now he had some hidden&nbsp;dastardly plan that was directed towards me that he was now unable to carry out because of the weather. Too bad for him.</p>
<p>This same friend claimed he had stolen a school bus when he was in the 4th grade, and also proclaimed that when he died the world would know about it. I haven&#8217;t kept in touch. We had a falling out, and perhaps it wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this event by the recent <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992575" target="_self">hail storm in China</a> <p>that killed 25 people. Egg shaped hail the report says. I suppose it&#8217;s not such a shock when you&nbsp;think about it, but dang, getting killed by hail? Bummer!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I understand the intent of a <a href="http://www.family.org/pplace/pi/allmusic/" target="_self">site that reviews top selling CD&#8217;s </a><p>for &#8220;Pro-Social Content&#8221; and &#8220;Objectionable Content&#8221;, the content of the reviews themselves can provide quite a chuckle. Some CD&#8217;s get bad marks for not making it clear if an &#8220;intimate&#8221; couple is married within the context of the song. That&#8217;s asking a little too much of the artist I&#8217;d venture. That&#8217;s like saying &#8220;Whoops, can&#8217;t give this CD good marks, we don&#8217;t know if the driver of the vehicle they describe is properly licensed.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>Personally I believe in teaching my values to my children in&nbsp;my home, and not being insanely protective about the worldly things. The world will exist despite my teachings to my children, and I feel it&#8217;s better to prepare my children with that thought in mind. Rather than convince my children that bullets don&#8217;t exist, I&#8217;d rather teach my children how to put on their bullet proof vests, knowing full well their values will be put to the test.</p></p>
