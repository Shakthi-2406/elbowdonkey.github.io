<div class="entry-content"><p>Obversations, thoughts, and experiences&nbsp;made and gained&nbsp;while relocating to the Portland area:</p>
<p><strong>California</strong></p>
<p>While eating Arby&#8217;s before getting on the road, Carrie says &#8220;Hey, is that your Dad&#8217;s friend?&#8221;. Before I get the chance to say &#8220;That&#8217;s the third time I&#8217;ve seen that wobbly headed freak walk by carrying an unopened can of Coke and a 32 ounce bottle of brown Gatorade since we sat down&#8221; she waves at him. He begins to head over to&nbsp;return her friendliness, stops about ten feet away, makes a noise unintelligable, then heads off in another direction in his now familiar wobbly fashion to my relief. We&#8217;ve placed this experience into the &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; category<sup><a href="#hairbraid">1</a><p>. </p><br />
<p>Fresno smells like rotten salad. There&#8217;s no real explanation. My theory is that it has something to do with the name Fresno. That was a big mistake made&nbsp;by the founding fathers of the city.</p><br />
<p>If it&#8217;s a Taco Bell, and it&#8217;s on Interstate 5 between the&nbsp;Grape Vine and, let&#8217;s be safe and just say the border of Oregon, don&#8217;t be tempted to eat there. Let this be a lesson to you: if the floor in the Taco Bell is supposed to be blue, but really looks black, then your food&nbsp;simply cannot taste as good, even if it&#8217;s in it&#8217;s most pure form.</p><br />
<p>Mount Shasta looks edible. It looks like a treat from Dairy Queen. Vanilla ice cream with hot fudge dribbled all over it. It would, however, be very difficult to eat, even if you only consider the shear volume.</p><br />
<p>At night, people think I&#8217;m shining my brights. I&#8217;m not. I have a truck, it rides a bit higher than a standard car, pickup, or <span class="caps">SUV</span>.&nbsp;Oncoming motorists&nbsp;flash their brights at me, at which point I feel it&#8217;s my responsibility as an American to defend their accusations and shine brights at them as quickly as possible&nbsp;to show them that I, indeed, am not being forgetful or discourteous and leaving my brights on. Perhaps if I showed a little less glee in doing this at almost every car that passes, Carrie would agree with my handling of the situation. While I can&#8217;t speak for her, I have an idea that she thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;a stupid guy thing&#8221;.</p><br />
<p>Don&#8217;t sleep in Fresno, even at a Super 8 Hotel. You&#8217;d think that the Super 8 Hotel is better by a magnitude of 2 compared to the Hotel 6. If this is so, then the Hotel 6 in Fresno must use piles of fluffed dirt for pillows, and slabs of recycled concrete for mattresses (no high quality slabs of granite in this metaphor).</p><br />
<p><strong>Oregon</strong></p><br />
<p>Grass. Look at all the grass. There must be thousands of square miles of grass to our left and right. Look, a sign that says &#8220;Grass Capital of the World&#8221;. No kidding.</p><br />
<p>Green. It&#8217;s very green here. It looks like we&#8217;re going to need some good umbrellas. It&#8217;s also very clean.</p><br />
<p>We arrived in Wilsonville late Saturday night. We were too tired to find the apartment, and couldn&#8217;t move in until Sunday anyhow, so we got a room. For the same price we paid for a dump in Fresno at the Super 8, we got a very nice, and very clean room at a Comfort Inn in Wilsonville. The next morning, we openened the blinds to the room, and what did my eyes behold? Across&nbsp;a field of grass stood a Fry&#8217;s Electronics. My love/hate relationship with the store would continue. The hate would be less as I came to find out last night. No sales tax in Oregon. Not a dime. And, not just one, but three people offered to help me find items in Fry&#8217;s. A miracle.</p><br />
<p>Sunday morning we moved into our apartment. An apartment complex of this quality in Southern California would cost triple for what we are paying in Oregon. No exaggeration.</p><br />
<p>Our apartment is now fully furnished and very livable. Cable modem and telephone get installed this week.</p><br />
<p><sup><a name="hairbraid">1</a></sup>I had a roommate when I was younger who decided to also invite his father in law to stay with us. It was actually his ex-wife&#8217;s father in law, and rather than try and explain that, I&#8217;ll get right into the explanation of the &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; category of experiences.</p><br />
<p>This new roommate slept on the couch, falling asleep to pornos. Again, more room for explanation that I will gloss over for the sake of brevity. And yes, this wasn&#8217;t a comfortable home environment for me. I changed that pretty quick, but I digress. This new roommate was an old man with very long, greasy biker hair. I seem to recall his beard was as long as his hair, and both had probably been growing without fear of scissors in their whole existance. This was wild man hair.</p><br />
<p>Carrie and I weren&#8217;t married yet. She came by to visit one time. I was in my room doing something, and she came bursting in, quickly shutting the door behind her. She was obviously very distraught, and in some kind of fix.</p><br />
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;I just told your roommate I&#8217;d braid his hair!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;<strong>What?</strong> You&#8217;re <em>crazy!</em>&#8221;</p><br />
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean too! He asked &#8216;Do you know how to braid hair?&#8217; and I said &#8216;Yes&#8217; then he said &#8216;Could you braid <em>my</em> hair?&#8217; and I said &#8216;Yes&#8217; and then I realized what I said and ran in here, what do I do?!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>Now you understand why Carrie and I have a classification of experiences called the &#8220;Sure I&#8217;ll braid your hair&#8221; experiences. Carrie is winning so far, with two confirmed experiences against my zero.</p>
