  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired</a> news:</p>
<p><i>Looks like the long dry spell in one Turkish village is just about over, in more ways than one. For a month now, the women in Sirt have been withholding sex until the menfolk provide running water to the village. Earlier this week, the guys finally caved in and asked the government to give them enough material to build a five-mile pipeline to a nearby water source. The government has reportedly agreed and the pipes are being readied for delivery. No word on whether the gals will relent now or wait until the system is actually built. The advice from here is to wait. Men are notorious for dragging their feet when it comes to home improvement projects.</i><br />
Might be a good idea to install the moulding on my 8 month old Pergo floor this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have this thing where I don&#8217;t like eating alone in a fast food place. Normally if I&#8217;m in a hurry and need to eat fast food, I&#8217;ll go through the drive-thru, but today, I stepped out of my comfort zone, and went inside.<br />
It really wasn&#8217;t that bad. Once I got over the fact that I had nothing to read or fiddle with or nobody to talk to while I ate, a calm washed over me, and everything was fine. My meal became what was important, and rather than taking forever to finish it, I finished it in &#8220;normal human eating speed&#8221; time.<br />
Incidentally, you can&#8217;t get cheese quesadillas at a Taco Bell in New Jersey, or any other state other than California for that matter. I think it&#8217;s because Californians know how to pronounce quesadillas more readily than the general populace of a state like New Jersey.</p>

I&#8217;m not a crazed fan of coasters mind you &#8211; they&#8217;re fun and all, but I don&#8217;t go out of my way to get on them.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rancid milk sucks! Nonfat milk has the ability to duck under the &#8220;Hello I&#8217;m filthy rancid milk&#8221; radar. It&#8217;s odor is satisfactory, but once in your mouth, something is incorrect.<br />
So, this morning, I pour myself a bowl of my beloved raisin bran. My raisin bran fills me up, gives me a good amount of fiber, and quells the incredible hunger I always wake up with. I finish off the box &#8211; that&#8217;s the last of it.</p>
<p>I pour milk on the cereal, and then head into my office to read the morning news on <span class="caps">CNN</span> or Slashdot. I get four bites into my mouth before I began to suspect that the taste of pure dirt and filth is not my morning mouth tricking me, but is indeed rancid milk.</p>
<p>Spit out the current bite, smell the milk &#8211; no smell. Sequestor just some milk, taste it. Does it taste bad? <b>Yes!</b> Rancid milk! Gag, wretch, run to the kitchen fighting back puking. Pull out the snake faucet, rinse out my mouth, prepare for expulsion of rancid milk from my belly (isn&#8217;t that the rule? Rancid milk always expels?).<br />
I&#8217;m still waiting, in fear. I feel fine now, but I&#8217;m not fond of the idea that I could ralph without warning at any second. This is not a good way to start a day. And I ruined the last bowl of raisin bran with the putrid liquid. Now I must go hungry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have noticed some new imagery in the title bar. There are several random images loading there, pictures of stuff that I think look cool close up. I&#8217;m very near-sighted, which means that without corrective lenses, I can see things as if my eyes are like microscopes. My camera has a macro setting on it that let&#8217;s me stay in focus at close range, which sort of simulates this microscopic vision of mine (although not as good).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just lost a little confidence in my eye doctor. They got my file mixed up with someone who only has one eye. That caused a very confusing conversation over the phone about how long a box of contact lenses should last.<br />
They said &#8220;Sir, you only have one eye, a box of 4 pairs should last you well over 4 months&#8221;.<br />
What if I did only have one eye and was wierd about it? She could have freaked me out pointing that out so obviously. And what if the one eyed person called in and had the same thing happen to them, except in reverse &#8220;Sir, you&#8217;ve got two healthy eyes, why would you want a designer eye patch?&#8221;</p>
