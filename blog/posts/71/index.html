  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recieved the following email from a friend this morning. Thought it was worth sharing.<br />
<div style="margin-left:75px;font-style:italic;"><br />
<p>My Dearest friends,</p><br />
<p>I am up late tonight, and I am pondering. Many of you may know that this is a favorite hobby of mine-to stay up and ponder at some of life&#8217;s most intriguing questions, both answered and unanswered. Questions regarding such pressing issues as Einstein&#8217;s Theory of Relativity (which I find myself supporting), or perhaps cures to life-threatening illnesses, or what I had for breakfast. </p><br />
<p>Tonight I am preoccupied with the classic 1989 film, &#8220;Bill and Ted&#8217;s Excellent Adventure&#8221;. How well did we know Bill S. Preston and Ted Theodore Logan? We know much about them from the movie. They are two badical dudes who grew up in San Dimas, California, they have an amazing band called &#8220;Wyld Stallyns&#8221;, and with the help of their friend Rufus, they are able to get an A on their history assignment. But I think the most amazing fact about their zany journey is that at the same time they take us back to extraordinary times in history and help us learn something at the same time, and teach us such exciting things.</p><br />
<p>Those are all &#8220;givens&#8221;. What I ask you is this: It is obvious that Ted Theodore Logan was the true winner when the accomplishments are compared. Ted got the better looking babe, he had the cooler hair, and he also went on to star in other hit films such as &#8220;Point Break&#8221; and &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. Ted obviously quit Wyld Stallyns and joined up with Dogstar. Dogstar has since moved out of their garage and has toured packed venues across the nation. What I find myself asking is, &#8220;What about Bill S. Preston??&#8221; How does he feel? What are his thoughts towards his life-long buddies success? Type in their names on a search engine, and the results are staggering. Ted Theodore Logan became successful, while on the other hand &#8211; Bill S. Preston got the raw end of the deal. If I have in any way conveyed the severity of this situation successfully to any of you, please respond with your thoughts.</p><br />
<p>In closing: Be excellent to each other.</p><br />
<p>Chad</p></div></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just thought of something. Actually, let&#8217;s backup and start over. I just made a breakthrough. I&#8217;ve discovered that I <strong>do not </strong><p>need to albumize every single photo I&#8217;ve ever taken in my life. It&#8217;s OK to keep and store every image, but not display every single one. No one wants to see the poorly lit shots, the out of focus or shaky shots, or shots of the sky with nothing to tell you what the shot actually is.</p><br />
<p>So, with that said, I&#8217;m going to change my photo album software somewhat. I typically take hundreds of pictures a day when on vacation. I&#8217;d say I average about 200 a day, which can get very boring to look at. I&#8217;m going to add a step in to my new album creation that let&#8217;s me select the pictures I want to end up on the site quickly and efficiently. I&#8217;m also going to smooth out some of the interface issues. My photos will become more enjoyable soon. I promise.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago I got beat up by <a href="http://www.wwfsuperstars.com/test/photo/" target="">Test</a> <p>from the <span class="caps">WWF</span>. I make no joke about it. It&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m not making it up. <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/" target="">Erik</a> and I were at some computer convention, and a company that made network equipment (I can&#8217;t even remember the name now), had a giant wrestling ring setup with those big puffy sumo suits in them, ready for two challengers.</p><br />
<p>Now, Erik and I aren&#8217;t idiots. We knew that by ensuring that we could wrestle eachother in those suits that our fun factor for the day would increase dramatically. So we pestered the booth people to let us duke it out. They said they&#8217;d pick us at the end of a presentation they were about to conduct, so we stuck around.</p><br />
<p>Once in the ring, we were helped into the suits, stood on our feet, and at the sound of a bell we were to try and pin eachother. Now, keep in mind, Erik is more than double my weight, so it might have seemed that he had an advantage over me, but it didn&#8217;t really make a difference. The suits hindered all movement. The most you could do was bounce in a general direction and hope for the best. That&#8217;s what Erik did the first round. He charged right at me, and before getting to me fell forward.&nbsp;I siezed that moment and tipped forward, pinning him. </p><br />
<p>The next round came, and my memories are a bit blurry about it, but Erik ended up pinning me.</p><br />
<p>The third and final round came, and I was poised to win. I was hopping about when suddenly I was going down fast! Test, the <span class="caps">WWF</span> Pro Wrestler who also weighed twice as much as me took a cheap shot to my back and close lined me.</p><br />
<p>My back has never been the same. This morning I was walking down my stairs, and <strong>zippow!</strong> An extremely sharp pain develops right between my shoulder blades. That damn cheap <span class="caps">WWF</span> wrestler. If I hadn&#8217;t signed a waiver, I would have sued him by now.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stayed up a few minutes longer tonight to code my Amazon Recommendation ColdFusion Custom Tag&#8482;. It works pretty good, except I&#8217;m still polishing the &#8220;randomness&#8221; of the recommendations. There&#8217;s an entire admin to the thing that makes it super easy to add a new Amazon product. I just add the <span class="caps">ASIN</span> (Amazon&#8217;s part number), my description of the product, and press a button and the admin does the rest. It grabs the title, the image, and sets the product into rotation. I&#8217;ll probably release it soon on my ColdFusion section.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think this is the fifth time I&#8217;ve accidentally ingested bad milk. There&#8217;s no mistaking it, but somehow when eating a bowl of cereal I manage to get about 5 or 6 bites in before I know that the cereal doesn&#8217;t taste like dirt, it&#8217;s the milk. Hopefully soon I&#8217;ll work up an immunity to it, and I&#8217;ll go on the seminar circuit getting rich off of telling people how to extend the life of their milk by just getting immune to spoiled milk. Brilliant!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just gave the site a minor facelift. Friends have asked &#8220;Did you paint that picture&#8221; (referring to the header image)&nbsp;when in reality it&#8217;s not a painting at all, it&#8217;s a photograph of a dock in the Carribean. I enjoy looking at graffitti, and this one was particularly interesting. Someone with no real artistic skill decided to write &#8220;Pork Boots&#8221; on the wall in the middle of the ocean on an itty bitty island.</p>
<p>On some of these Carribean island docks it seems that everyone uses the same pallette, which just so happens to match the pallette of cruise ships. Without really knowing the entire story I conclude that those who paint the boats in Carribean ports also have a tradition of using the same paint to &#8220;&#8221;/mb/photo_journal.cfm?pa=display&amp;id=2173&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;sign the guest book<p>&#8220;.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love illustration. When I say illustration, I&#8217;m talking about the funny pictures you might see in magazine articles to help convey the point of the article. I love making illustrations, and looking at, and trying to understand illustrations. To help ring in the new year, I&#8217;ve collected some links to illustrators whom I&#8217;m particularly fond of their work:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So on the last day of the year I get together with a few friends to see the first installment of the Lord of the Rings movies and I&nbsp;can&#8217;t say I was impressed. While it looked neat, and seemed well done, I just got bored of the fighting. I think I saw hundreds of orcs fall without the hero, Frodo,&nbsp;recieving a scratch. I suppose you could say other than the impossibility of a 3 foot man not getting killed by blood thirsty savage beasts twice his size, the movie was entertaining, and worth the $6.00 I paid to see it during the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Perhaps I enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums so much that Lord of the Rings didn&#8217;t stand a chance. Five minutes into The Royal Tenenbaums I knew I&#8217;d be buying it when it appeared on <span class="caps">DVD</span>. That movie is a piece of art, each frame designed to tell a story. In one scene, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are sitting apart from eachother, and neither has even uttered a word and the entire theater is laughing. I left this movie very impressed, and inspired to be creative. A fine movie indeed.</p>
