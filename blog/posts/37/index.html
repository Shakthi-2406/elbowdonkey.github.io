  <div class="entry-content"><p>Captain Kangaroo passed away today at the age of 76. I can&#8217;t think of a single show from my childhood that I remember more fondly than Captain Kangaroo. There were a few years before Kindergarten where the show was my life. I&#8217;d make weekly treks to the public library with my mom and brother where I&#8217;d pick up a Captain Kangaroo kit that would coincide with the show. I&#8217;d complete every puzzle, every connect the dots, every science expirement, every letter writing challenge. I even had a bowl hair cut to match Captain Kangaroo&#8217;s. When Mr. Green Jeans would show up, I&#8217;d yell &#8220;MR <span class="caps">GREEN</span> <span class="caps">JEANS</span>!&#8221; in my impecable four year old way. I always knew when Mr. Moose was going to get buried in ping pong balls, and always wished Bunny Rabbit could get away with eating too many carrots.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby introduced me to reading, writing, and drawing with his Picture Pages segments on the Captain Kangaroo show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Picture pages, picture pages, time to get your picture pages, time to get your crayons and your pencils&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had a big fat permanent marker that would make the most satisfying permanent marker noise as he drew. If he messed up, the pen would squeal. I can still hear the pen, and when I equate creativity to that noise still. When I went to Art Center, I had a set of rendering markers that would squeak as a drew, and I remembered.</p>
<p>Most kids today probably couldn&#8217;t sit through ten minutes of Captain Kangaroo. Kids can choose from a near infinite amount of more exciting media than Captain Kangaroo, and when you&#8217;re a kid, you lack the wisdom to see the sublimity in shows that allow a child to construct profound new knowledge from simple and gentle concepts.</p>
<p>Bob Keeshan, the creator of the show, and Captain Kangaroo himself, knew something about kids that I think few people but marketing companies understand today &#8211; kids learn more in their first six years of life than the rest of their life combined. Fast food companies are keenly aware of this, and spend billions on children under the age of six, knowing that there is no better time to build brand loyalty then in the earliest years.</p>
<p>Bob thought that shows like Barney are fluff, and that nearly every other show made for kids these days is fluff. Today&#8217;s shows are developed in large part by adults who grew up on <span class="caps">MTV</span>, where a scene change is required nearly every 3 seconds. Compare any show made for kids today to Captain Kangaroo or Mr. Rogers, and you&#8217;ll notice the pace and the tempo is vastly different.</p>
<p>The pace that shows like Captain Kangaroo and Mr. Rogers had seemed just perfect. No flashiness, moments of peace, where a child can digest something without being pummelled by frantic purple dinosaurs and kids who can&#8217;t stop running around lip syncing to studio compressed and polished voices. Funded not by advertisers, but by educators, charities, parents, grants, and companies who&#8217;s motives were pure.</p>
<p>Shows like Captain Kangaroo and Mr. Rogers were never half hour infomercials for the latest Barney or Elmo doll. Name nearly any familiar kids show from today, and you&#8217;ll be able to find toys, clothing, toothbrushes, cereal bowls, bed sheets, pajamas, video games, bicycles, bubble bath, sunglasses, shoes, and underwear with characters from kids shows.</p>
<p>The motives of a kids show are difficult to view without skepticism when the creators control merchandising or licensing empires.</p>
<p>Bob Keeshan, and his wisdom on shows that strengthen and teach kids simple things, will be sorely missed. I can only hope that the show continues in reruns, or comes out on <span class="caps">DVD</span> so I can teach my children to become excited beyond compare to see a moose puppet get buried in ping pong balls on every single show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished my contract with Xerox on Friday, which means that I&#8217;ll be working a lot more from my home office. I&#8217;m pretty excited, because at Xerox I had limited time (and room) to make my work area optimal, and now that I&#8217;m the boss of me, I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>I now have two 19&quot; Flatscreen CRTs on my desktop, with sexy silver trim, running off a video card with a very impressive sounding title of GeForce FX 5200 with dual display support and 128MB <span class="caps">DDR</span> with some insane sounding clock speed of 2,320 miles per hour, with included hovercraft pants and rocket propelled impeller. Or something like that.</p>
<p>The twins, as they will now be called (joining, not usurping, the title of any other pair that deserves to be called &#8220;the twins&#8221;) have a button on them that says &#8220;UltraBrite Mode&#8221;. When you press this button, say adios to your eyebrows, because it&#8217;s so bright they will run and hide behind your ears.</p>
<p>And the resolutions I can display, holy cow. If I had a magnifying glass, I could see the words on the combined resolution of 3200&#215;1200, but instead, I prefer the absolutely flicker freeness of 2560&#215;1024.</p>
<p>To top off the productivity charts, I purchased a headset for my cordless phone. The headset makes such an incredible difference. I can make code changes and continue being productive while on the phone now, when I used to have to either malform my neck, or bust out the one handed speed typing, which, while impressive, doesn&#8217;t match the speed of two handed typing.</p>
<p>You can just call me Home Office SuperMan from now on, thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve got a thing about haircuts, which regular readers will recognize as nothing new. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I&#8217;ll put off getting a haircut for way too long, and then when I&#8217;m there, I have nothing to think about except how awkward getting a haircut is. Here is some person harvesting dead matter off of my head, and if I don&#8217;t hold really still, this person will harvest too much, or too little and just totally mess up my day. And given the chance, I&#8217;ll sit completely silent the entire time, and only speak if spoken to. I just want it to be over with, but today my attitude has changed. I&#8217;ll go to the same place from now on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no other way to put this &#8211; I think the lady who cut my hair today drinks shampoo and butters her toast with pomade. I have never heard such crazy talk out of a haircutter (the reason I&#8217;ll be going back).</p>
<p>Some choice selections, in no particular order:</p>
<p>After a comb through, with scissors and comb pointed at my mop for emphasis, &#8220;Your hair is like a grove of redwoods, except I won&#8217;t have to feel guilty for clear cutting!&#8221;</p>
<p>I joked about how maybe my hair grew fast because of something in the water. After silence of about a minute or two, &#8220;I know why your hair grows so fast &#8211; do you like cheddar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has your hair always grown fast?&#8221;, she asked. I said &#8220;Yep&#8221;, and then she offered &#8220;My guess is that your hair grows 3/10ths of an inch per day&#8221; without hesitation. I remembered the number, and did some math when I got home, and she&#8217;s almost exactly right. She would be more right had I told her the correct date of my last haircut, which I had to lookup. The last time I had my haircut, <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/perm.cfm/id/534">it snowed</a> and I had said I got it around Thanksgiving. She&#8217;s a genius. And to compare, 3/10ths of an inch is just under a millimeter.</p>
<p>After telling me how she used to cut her kids&#8217; hair when they were younger at home, &#8220;I can&#8217;t cut hair at home anymore, the dog tries to eat the cut hair and barks at the clippers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to groom horses before cutting hair.&#8221; She said this as she was brushing off my neck, finishing the haircut. And it shows in my hair. Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s not the best haircut, but I&#8217;ll probably go back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I was trying to instruct <a href="http://www.torrez.org">Andre Torrez</a>, who is stubborn when it comes to thinking of everything in terms of cost/benefit, about the costs and benefits of going to <span class="caps">SXSW</span> this year. I was saying &#8220;man, you gotta divide the cost of the trip up amongst whatever you get out of it&#8221;. And I meant it. So I went and did some calculations for the benefit of all, but keep in mind that they&#8217;re biased towards what I get out of <span class="caps">SXSW</span>.</p>
<p><b>Total Trip Cost <span style="color:red;">*</span>:</b> $1,395.00</p>
<p>Now, divide that up into &#8220;important units&#8221;. An important unit represents some measurable thing I get out of <span class="caps">SXSW</span>. New friends, free stuff, etc. Here&#8217;s my table of important units:<br />
<div style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:15px;"><br />
<table><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td width="20%">Introductions to new people</td><td width="10%">110</td><td width="70%">I&#8217;m certain that number is higher, but that&#8217;s the count of people I made notes of who I&#8217;d met (and not just seen).</td></tr><br />
<tr><td>Meaty conversations</td><td>260</td><td>I&#8217;m counting  the initial conversations with people I met, as well as repeat conversations. If I wasn&#8217;t listening in a panel, I was talking with someone. I went hoarse.</td></tr><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td>Panels</td><td>20</td><td>I think there were 20. I figure an average of five per day, including keynotes</td></tr><br />
<tr><td>Kick!</td><td>1</td><td>Kickball with a bunch of geeks, some in shape and some not? Worth more than whatever value I&#8217;m about to put on it&#8230;</td></tr><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td>Good Fray stories</td><td>5</td><td>Some were excellent</td></tr><br />
<tr><td>Bad Fray stories</td><td>-3</td><td>Some made me want to die</td></tr><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td>Artsy Photos</td><td>20</td><td>Not that <span class="caps">SXSW</span> present unique opportunities, but it helps the mood considerably</td></tr><br />
<tr><td>Swag Bag</td><td>1</td><td>Carrie uses it now. It&#8217;s a nice canvas bag. I think it came with some mints last year too.</td></tr><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td>Free Drinks</td><td>3</td><td>I think there were more free drinks, but in any case, they were soft drinks for me.</td></tr><br />
<tr><td>Packet Sniffing</td><td>1</td><td>Nothing more fun than a wide open WiFi network. The dirt I collected has yet to be valued.</td></tr><br />
<tr style="background-color:#F9FFF0;"><td><b>Total Important Units</b></td><td>419</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><br />
<tr><td><b>Average cost per unit:</b></td><td> $3.33</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Obviously some of the units are worth more than $3.33, and in some cases (Bad Fray stories) hike the average unit cost up, but overall, I&#8217;d say that $3.33 per unit is nice. Also, had I been a wallflower, the average cost would have risen considerably. And at $3.33 per introduction, it still seems a bit high to me.</p>
<p>And even with all the calculating, I still can&#8217;t put a price on the motivation I come away with. It&#8217;s not so much the panels themselves that are inspiring, but the social interaction with a lot of really smart and creative people from all sort of different walks of life. That has a value that I can&#8217;t figure out how to calculate, but surely it brings down the average unit cost.</p>
<p>And regarding what units to assign cost to, it all depends on what you&#8217;re looking to get out of the event. If you&#8217;re in it for the free pens, then factor that in. Factor in negative units (bad joke, awkward moments, etc) as well.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;">*</span> I didn&#8217;t include the cost of missing work into the total trip cost, but could have and probably should have. I didn&#8217;t want people knowing how much money I make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever heard of the country Niue? Neither have I, but then again, it has a population of about 1200 people. But it may not be an independent country much longer. Just recently <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/sundaystartimes/0,2106,2779484a6005,00.html">a cyclone hit the island nation</a>, and now the Niue government leaders are considering joining New Zealand after suffering over $50M in damages. Which gets me thinking.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Bill Gates have an island nation? I know he&#8217;s all into making <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/WealthClock">money</a>, and would probably lose on the deal, but he should own an island nation. He could be really bizarre, and start all sorts of crazy traditions, pave the roads of the island with rat bones, require that every citizen get a tattoo of the Pink Panther, pipe mashed potatoes to every house, or some crazy wigged out thing. Which gets me thinking even more.</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t Bill Gates more blatantly evil? Some might argue that he is, or he&#8217;s at least subtley evil, but I mean seriously, can&#8217;t he be a Dr. Evil? Or maybe the other extreme, why doesn&#8217;t he run around showering acts of kindness and generosity on unsuspecting people. I know he gives to charity quite often, but those are obvious tax shelters. It seems to me if you&#8217;ve got the sort of drive, ambition, and money that Bill has that you&#8217;d be all over doing insane stuff, not just fiddling around with your silly computer software empire.</p>
<p>If I had Bill Gates money, the first thing I&#8217;d do is start a think tank. I&#8217;d hire, then retire, the smartest people I&#8217;ve met or worked with in the past, and I&#8217;d create an environment that encouraged cool new ideas. If the ideas weren&#8217;t flowing, fine, there&#8217;d be plenty of money to burn while playing video games or air hockey.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;d focus on my house. I&#8217;d want nano paint walls, and a chip embedded in my body that told my house where I was at all times. Walk into a room &#8211; the walls change color according to my settings &#8211; settings I input through my dancing shoe computers. Need to send an email? Simple, do a little tap dance to spell out the words. Want a book from Amazon. As easy as an Irish Jig.</p>
<p>The fruit bowls in my house would be robotic. No matter what, fresh navel oranges would abound in every fruit bowl. If a bowl wasn&#8217;t full of fresh navel oranges, a robotic device of some sort would make sure it was full of fresh navel oranges.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;d be no walking in my house. I&#8217;d want nano floors. Step out of my nano car, and the floor would move me to the bathroom after work, using cilia or whatever a nano floor does to move me. I could even sit down, and I&#8217;d still get to the bathroom, where the bathroom would be smart enough to &#8220;take care of business&#8221; for me.</p>
<p>All of these niceties would be there so that I could remain focused on building a great island nation, where everything was backwards. Walking, talking, writing, driving, everything &#8211; reverse. And you&#8217;d be paid to live there, because all that kind of stuff is hard to do.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a sample of what I&#8217;d do with Bill Gates money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After this week&#8217;s dump of snow and then ice, I&#8217;m ready to have someone come knock me out until June. The snow was fun for about two days, but now my feet are constantly wet as I have to walk through piles of wet slush, and I have yet to travel over 30 mph. My body can&#8217;t handle it. The infinitely small atoms in my body require higher velocity; they&#8217;re getting restless. I need to see some foilage that isn&#8217;t pure white or encased in ice.<br />
On a loosley related note, by June of this year, I&#8217;ll have been moaning about something on this site for at least 6 years. That&#8217;s a bit longer than the term &#8220;blog&#8221; has been around, and if I looked hard enough, I could probably find at least a year of entries prior to June 1998. For that, I think I deserve a &#8220;Lifetime Achievement&#8221; Nomination for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2004">Bloggies.</a> You know what to do. (And yes, I have no shame).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve launched yet <a href="http://www.digitalslr.org/">another site</a> (step #2139 in my Dominate the Entire Universe (Except for Bunnies) and Beyond if Said Beyond Exists Plan). This one is the real deal, a high class production. Not some kind of sham. No posts about hairsuits or nail clippings. Read: quality goods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in over my head when it comes to fancy photography equipment, so to help pay for it, I have to talk about what I know. If it works out, the site helps lots of people, and I get rewarded by having the site reduce my expenses.</p>
<p>So go visit <a href="http://www.digitalslr.org/">digitalslr.org</a>, read the content, and tell me how to make it better. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time has come to check in with my resolutions for 2003.</p>
<p><i>1. Cut my hair before it begins to put strain on my neck.</i><br />
I was so good with this in England. On a weekend, I&#8217;d walk over to some hair place and get my hair done by this Turkish dude named CJ. Everytime, someone would come in off the street and have a conversation with him. My hair was so nice in England. I did very poorly in Oregon, both before England and after. Result: minor improvement over the 2002.</p>
<p><i>2. Give the milk a sniff before consumption.</i><br />
So I totally like, rocked on this one. I don&#8217;t think I had a single rancid milk encounter. I&#8217;m not even going to look back at the entries for 2003 to verify, I remember none of them now. Result: major improvment over 2002. I&#8217;m the boss.</p>
<p><i>3. Finish what I start.</i></p>
<p>I was crazy to make that resolution. Result: no change over 2002.</p>
<p><i>4. Resume my editorial illustration career.</i></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I painted a picture of the guy who scared me while playing table tennis at work. He&#8217;s from India, and before we began playing, he took his shoes and socks off, and rolled up his sleeves, then crouched into a praying mantis position. He worked me. Result: resolution accomplished, just in the nick of time.</p>
<p><i>5. Make serious progress on the big fancy secret project.</i></p>
<p>Good thing I have tons of super secret projects. Result: progress made on all super secret projects. I win!</p>
<p><i>6. Fall down less.</i><br />
I think I can count on the fingers that are still left the times I fell. Result: major improvement over 2002, although the time I pushed yellow fat back in through a gash in my hip almost swings it the wrong way.</p>
<p><i>7. Become 100% debt free.</i><br />
Was nearly there for a while, the only debt was a car payment. Buying a house this year put us in the whole a bit too, but I&#8217;m happy to have gotten so close. The currents debts aren&#8217;t so disagreeable. Result: didn&#8217;t make it, but don&#8217;t care anymore.</p>
<p><i>8. Teach Leah morse code instead of English as her first language.</i><br />
Didn&#8217;t work, but we have started to suggest the Colonel Sanders is her Grandpa. Result: failed, due to lack of knowledge of morse code.</p>
<p><i>9. Actually truly care more about friends and family.</i><br />
Pretty sure I did well with this. I made a point of being a bit more charitable and sacrificing my own wants and needs for others. Results: mild victory &#8211; could have done better.</p>
<p><i>10. Eat less Wheat Thins.</i><br />
I set up a three step program to accomplish this. I was on Original Wheat Thins at first, then I tapered off my intake by eating Sodium Free Wheat Things, and then the real kicker was buying a box of Honey Flavored Wheat Thins. Like a rat that won&#8217;t eat poison twice, I&#8217;ve kicked my Wheat Thins eating binges. Result: I&#8217;m the king of not eating too many Wheat Thins. My seminar tour starts this spring.</p>
<p><i>11. Build a halfpipe.</i><br />
Sadly, this resolution did not resolve. Believe me, I was dilligent. Every property we looked at when looking for our home was sized up for possible halfpipe readiness. But even had we purchased a halfpipe happy home, I probably still would have failed. Just too busy this year. Result: failed.<br />
<i>12. Come up with a perfect system for managing wires.</i><br />
I was totally insane to even think it possible. Result: idiot for thinking it possible.</p>
<p><i>13. Register my truck in Oregon.</i><br />
What? It&#8217;s January 4th, 2004? My registration expired you say? Result: idiot for thinking it possible.</p>
<p><i>14. Realize my dream of training turkeys to play ping pong in the local county competitive table tennis circuit.</i><br />
No comment.<br />
<i>15. Ride a Segway.</i><br />
I thought for sure I&#8217;d have a chance this year, but no. But, I did see one in person. Not just one, but like six. Six girls on Segways zipped along by us while we were eating in an outdoor cafe in Paris on the grounds of the Louvre. I was speechless, and before I could chase them down, they were gone. It wasn&#8217;t until we got back that the link to the tour company that rents the Segways out started making the rounds on the net. Result: I could taste victory, but alas, I failed.<br />
<i>16. Let stinkfactor.com die.</i><br />
No way, totally failed. It was a joke anyhow. <a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com/">stinkfactor.com lives</a>. Result: failure.<br />
<i>17. Let stinkmachine.com flourish.</i><br />
Failed. Still working on this one. Result: made a lot of progress, but nonetheless, failed.<br />
<i>18. Armwrestle an astronaut, preferably Buzz Aldrin.</i><br />
Didn&#8217;t happen. I was hoping someone, like maybe an astronaut, would end up at my site and make the arrangments. I might carry this one over into 2004<br />
<i>19. Catch a cat hump (you gotta be pretty fast).</i><br />
Didn&#8217;t even get close to this one. It&#8217;s impossible. Not even real scientists can catch a cat hump, and if you&#8217;ve ever seen video footage, it&#8217;s fake. Result: failed.<br />
<i>20. Go a month without spending a dime, driving my car, or watching television.</i><br />
Came pretty close to doing one or the other, but never hit the trifecta. Result: came close, but failed.<br />
&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m pleased with the overall result, but I damn myself when I make up insane resolutions. My next set will be slam dunk easy after last year. But seriously, 2003 was a rollercoaster. It put hair on my chest, it was that rough. 2004 better be a walk in the park, because 2003 was like four years in one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s totally snowing in Oregon right now. Not just rain pretending to be snow, but huge fluffly flakes are falling out of the sky and piling up on the ground. I&#8217;m excited. Everyone at work is smiling. It&#8217;s pretty darn cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In our new house there is a window downstairs beside our front door that looks right out on to our porch. Anyone standing at our door step can see right into our house, and see into our living room.</p>
<p>This morning, as I was in my skivvies and feeling a bit exposed, I proceeded to run for cover, thinking someone was at the door. As I began to round the corner, out of site of the window, my socked feet betrayed me. Friction was no longer, and I was going down. If skateboarding has taught me anything, its taught me how to fall down, and in the nanosecond of time I had to comprehend the situation, I instructed my body to rotate so that I wouldn&#8217;t smash my head into hardwood.</p>
<p>Leah stood and watched as my heel buried itself into the short wall seperating our family room from our dining room. This is what happens when one buries their heel into the wall:</p>
<p><a href="images/heel_hole_600.jpg"><img src="images/heel_hole_300.jpg" width="300" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It turns out no one was at the door in the first place, and both Leah and Carrie thought it hilarious. Now I need to figure out how to fix the hole before the mouse decides it a cozy place.</p>
