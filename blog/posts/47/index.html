  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been staying at a&nbsp;hotel for the past couple of weeks while we wait to move into a proper English house. Every morning I go to the hotel restaurant and have a traditional English breakfast. Despite the lack of taste it acts as a sort of food insurance policy &#8211; if I simply can&#8217;t stomach any of the foods placed before me for the rest of the day, at least I had that big breakfast.</p>
<p>Usually the restaurant is pretty empty. As I walk in, normally, I get a greeting from an ultra polite waiter who I can&#8217;t tell if he&#8217;s nervous or if its simply some kind of act. Either way, this morning I had no greeting. The place was packed. All fifteen&nbsp;tables were taken except for one in the center of the room. It was hot a stuffy, as the people who occupied it were all huge men.</p>
<p>I take the one seat (not my normal number 15 by the sun filled door to the garden) and wait for my waiter (oh the irony). While waiting, I realize that every 2.5 meter tall man in that room is Russian, and they are all talking very furiously. I find myself amused by this, because I know this is a special moment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tittering away steeped in my own asmusement for a few minutes when suddenly one of the biggest of the Russians to my right offers a quite &#8220;Shhh&#8221;. The room falls deadly silent. It remains silent while the waiter brings me my food. It remains silent while I eat my beans. It remains silent the entire time I&#8217;m there, except for one final phrase uttered in a commanding but thick Russian accent:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, can I have four sandwiches with bread, ham, cheese, and moooostard please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room explodes into laughter. I have yet to figure out what to make of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really do have nothing to say. I&#8217;m know it must be a curiosity to some about how I&#8217;m handling living in a new country, but there&#8217;s really not much to say. Aside from the odd bits of vocabulary differences, work is the same, home life is the same, and goals and desires are the same. Even the weather is the same.</p>
<p>I think not having an Internet connection at home has really put a stop to a lot of blog reading, and communication, which perhaps explains the recent lack of blog entries. And with the intensity of my day job, it&#8217;s very difficult to justify taking some time to update my site.</p>
<p>So, all I can say is hang in there. We&#8217;re moving into a house hopefully this weekend, at which point I&#8217;ll do my best to get a better connection so I can do some serious work, and some serious blog updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m reading William Gibson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399149864/michaelbuffin-20" target="">Pattern Recognition</a><p>, and in it, the protagonist talks about London being a mirror world to New York. Everything is the same, but at the same time, different.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m experiencing that same kind of realization. I can get whatever I could get in the states, except it has a slight variation. Soda is slightly more carbonated. Chips are crisps. Cookies are biscuits. Shrimp are prawns, trucks are lorries, dumpsters are skips, elevators are lifts, vacuum cleaners are hoovers, ad infinitum.</p><br />
<p>And talking about mirror world, driving on the opposite side of the road is more a mind challenge than anything else. The trick is to soften the once hard as stone rules in your mind that driving on the left side of the road is forbidden. Once that&#8217;s handled, you start to get to used to it, and it&#8217;s almost as if the now malleable &#8220;sides&#8221; rule is now satisfied to work for keeping you from driving on the right.</p><br />
<p>Leah, Carrie, and sister-in-law Stacey are taking to the mirror world as well as can be expected with jet lag. The body and mind don&#8217;t take to the mirror time as quickly, so they&#8217;re going through the requisite sleeping disorders. I think last night was the turn around point &#8211; everyone slept through the night I think, with only one little cry session from Leah (who now has three teeth showing, and another on the way).</p><br />
<p><a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/" target="">Matt</a> just suggested that I get in touch with some London bloggers and have them show us around, so, if you&#8217;re a London blogger, <a href="comments.cfm?id=452" target="">drop me a note</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I keep meaning to sit down and write an extensive report of my travels thus far, and what has happened since I&#8217;ve arrived in lovely England, but I have to say, both my jetlag and work schedule is intense. Additionally, I have no Internet access at home, and updating at work is difficult at best.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give a teaser story though.</p>
<p><strong>Danish Pig Snorter</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve accepted that my lot in life is to sit next to lunatics on airplanes. Between Seattle and Copenhagen, I thought I&#8217;d dodged fate and managed to sit next to a normal person. Somewhere over Greenland, after having a plump Danish lady open mouth snore right in my ear, I decided to intervene. I nudged her with my elbow. Without any exaggeration, I swear she began snorting like a pig. I was elated at first, my little coup against the snoring had resulted in a very funny situation, but elation turned into fear as she kept going. After a good minute or two (an eternity), she woke up and scratched her head for a minute or so, then resumed open mouth snoring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Note to self: never again try to rebuild the web servers while planning a move to London (which includes packing everything up and putting it into storage)&nbsp;and working a full time job. But all that&#8217;s behind me, or it will be starting Saturday. Saturday I fly to Heathrow and prepare to have Carrie and Leah come out a week later (they&#8217;ll be visiting in California for a week before coming to the UK).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was messing around with stuff on the webserver and broke it all. And then I thought &#8220;dang, I&#8217;m too busy to deal with this right now&#8221; and let it sit for a day or two. But as I was eating lunch, it suddenly came to me how to fix the problem, and it took me all of two minutes.</p>
<p>Planning for this England trip is turning me into an idiot. My mind is all <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/classic/breakfast/stories/s546647.htm" target="">curfuffled</a><p>&nbsp;up.</p><br />
<p>Bad news. My fix fixed everything but the Moveable Type sites and anything <span class="caps">PHP</span> related. And I&#8217;m really not going to touch those until next Tuesday, when the new servers arrive.</p><br />
<p>Also, I&#8217;m an <a href="http://www.adultskateboarderssociety.com" target=""><span class="caps">ASS</span></a> member for the month of April, which means I get to fall on my ass more. Did I mention I own haulingass.net? I love that. I keep meaning to put a logo of someone hauling a donkey in a wheelbarrow up, and pointing the domain there. I think that&#8217;s so clever.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Traffic has quadrupled in the last four days. And I have no idea why. I&#8217;ve looked at the referers, but they show no new sources of traffic. It apparently looks like honest to goodness traffic from individuals or robots. I don&#8217;t discriminate between the two, so I&#8217;m happy either way.</p>
<p>But bandwidth is pinched! I can&#8217;t even get to my own site half the time from the office, and people keep sending me messages saying &#8220;oh hell fury Michael! Your site is down, are you crapping your pants or what?!&#8221;. The truth is, I care not, because:</p>
<p>Good things are afoot. I ordered two new webservers to host my projects&nbsp;which will very shortly be living at <a href="http://www.cascadia.net" target="">cascadia.net</a><p>&nbsp;(a standup, no monkey business company). These servers do it all, including robotic massage. The timing couldn&#8217;t be more perfect either as I get ready to pack up my apartment and move what I&#8217;m guessing is 200,040 miles away. My apartment is currently the high tech colo facility, and when I say high tech, I&#8217;m lying. It really is just a router and two servers piled in a heap in the corner, providing a safe warm haven for the hordes of horse ants in my house.</p><br />
<p>Which leads me to a point. I&#8217;ll have two computers that I won&#8217;t be lugging to England with me. I&#8217;m looking for a good cause (which includes donating them to family). If you have a truly good idea for what to do with them, <a href="comments.cfm?id=448" target="">let&#8217;s hear it</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m supposed to talk about this yet, but I&#8217;m going to anyhow. Carrie, Ultrasupersonic Baby Super&nbsp;Star and I are moving to London, England for 6 months. Isn&#8217;t that wild? We&#8217;re nervous and excited. We leave in a few weeks, and there&#8217;s so much to do before we go.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help.</strong></p>
<p>Before leaving, I have to purchase and configure two servers. One will be a web server, the other a database server. I&#8217;m looking for good deals on 1U Rackmount servers. The lowest price I can find is $740 for an <span class="caps">AMD</span> 1700+ with 1GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a 40GB HD. If you know of a similar setup for less money, let me know.</p>
<p>Camera lenses, as far as I know, are a lot cheaper in the US, so before I go, I want to pick up two lenses for my Nikon D100. A 17mm prime, or 14mm zoom (to 28mm), and a nice telephoto (90mm to whatever, as long as it&#8217;s portable). I&#8217;ve found the Tokina 17mm prime for about $370, and haven&#8217;t priced telephotos but they&#8217;re about the same price. Do you know of where to purchase a cheap super wide angle lens for the Nikon?</p>
<p>How do you think I should handle banking? I&#8217;ll be getting paid by my US based contracting company, and I was thinking that if they did direct deposit, I could have access to my funds through <span class="caps">ATM</span> cards in the UK. Is this crazy?</p>
<p>What do you think I should do with my truck? Do I need to do anything special if it&#8217;s going to sit for 6 months? Should I just try to sell it?</p>
<p>I have so much to do in the next three weeks, I swear my brain is going to melt.</p>
