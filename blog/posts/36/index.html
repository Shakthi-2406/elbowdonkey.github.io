  <div class="entry-content"><p>I start a new job today, which has nothing to do with the lack of blog entries recently. I&#8217;m hoping that, as part of my getting ready for work routine, that I&#8217;ll be able to work in a blog entry. Since <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, I&#8217;ve been on a full on veg-out kick, knowing that my days of work-at-home glory were numbered. I will fix that though. April will be the month of daily (at least) blog entries, you just wait and see.<br />
On another note &#8211; <a href="http://www.wordphoto.org">wordPhoto.org</a> is providing great satisfaction. At best, I&#8217;d hoped for about twenty active participants, but it will break the 100 user mark today. The quality of some of the photographs are simply great, and it&#8217;s great to think I help encourage that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been going full tilt on this project for the past couple of months (years), and today, it&#8217;s officially live.<br />
<a href="http://www.stinkmachine.com">stinkmachine.com</a> is a store designed around the idea of selling both Carrie&#8217;s and my creative stuff, currently in the form of T-shirts. The entire operation, from the web sales front to the actual printing of the shirts is family run. The printing is done in one of the best screen printing shops anywhere, where my Dad (who&#8217;s been screen printing for over 30 years) has helped put together an easy system for printing and shipping shirts with minimal overhead and very flexible minimum print run requirements.<br />
Please spread the word about the site. Within a month or two a generous affiliate program will be launched making it all worth your while.<br />
I&#8217;m also looking for feedback on anything &#8211; if you&#8217;ve got it, email me or comment below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent $97.00 on one of the best lenses I&#8217;ve shot with yet &#8211; a Nikkor 1.8 50mm. I&#8217;ve done nothing to the following image except resize it and compress it. The full version (a 1MB+ file) really shows the crispness that good lenses can capture. From now on, nothing but Nikon lenses for me. The subject helped too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picture my child as this sort of vast and impossible to comprehend vessel for gathering and understanding knowledge. Most of the time, you don&#8217;t notice that everything is new to her, and that everything is beginning to make connections with her. But sometimes, she&#8217;ll do things that take your breath away, and make you realize how incredible human beings are.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been using words a lot lately, and I mean a whole lot. The last time we counted, there were at least 32 distinct and individual words that we knew she used regularly. That was nearly four months &#8211; since then, we&#8217;ve stopped counting, and know that even if we did count, she&#8217;d likely double the list by the time we were done writing it down.</p>
<p>But what took my breath away tonight is merely that she noticed the stars in the night sky. Her mom was holding her, and my daughter was curious. Leah pointed up and her mom said &#8220;stars&#8221;, and with that, she&#8217;s now curious about the universe beyond her ever growing world.</p>
<p>And finally, this girl is undeniably my daughter. Instead of the usual Finding Nemo, tonight we watched Transworld Skateboarding&#8217;s Sight Unseen video. Focusing on the video dominated her attention, and after a few handrails and lofty indy grabs, she uttered &#8220;Skateboard. Whoa. Cool. Weeeeee&#8221; and twirled about the room, obviously stoked about David Cardiel&#8217;s line.</p>
<p>Thinking about her age brings about a paradox of emotions: it&#8217;s amazing that she&#8217;s this aware of her world at only 17 months, and it&#8217;s amazing that just yesterday she had her first birthday.</p>
<p>Regarding the title, I often feel that rather than parents, we&#8217;re merely stewards of an angel. Since the day she was born her personality and her soul have been strong enough to overwhelm whatever exhaustion as parents we have, and as her body begins to grow into that personality it keeps us going strong.</p>
<p>And soon we&#8217;ll have two. We&#8217;re expecting a boy on May 24th or thereabouts, and can&#8217;t imagine how we&#8217;re going to survive. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll manage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mowed my lawn today for the first time since we&#8217;ve lived here. And when I say today, I mean yesterday, because what was just recently Wednesday is now Thursday.</p>
<p>I also bought my first lawnmower ever. At the end of a rolled steel handlebar is a little cube of a machine that has the power of six horses. I have a stampede ready in the tool shed.</p>
<p>This was all a very sudden decision though not an impulsive one. I was working away in the home office on Tuesday, and looked up from my work and out the window and I saw some dude in a green mini-van taking a photograph of my house. He was just sitting there, camera pointed right at me, taking a picture. No doubt I was quick enough to present my best side, but a troubling cloud continued to hang over me after he finished. Was this the evil <span class="caps">HOA</span> coming to catch me in my lawn neglect? Indeed, the lawn had yellowed. Before this peeper had taken a picture, I was in lawn neglect heaven. I was happy about having no motivation whatsoever to cut my lawn.</p>
<p>So, wanting to get that monkey off my back, I bought a lawn mower and I cut my lawn, and then fertilized with one thousand year old Columbia River salmon.</p>
<p>So take that <span class="caps">HOA</span> Nazi (I mean that with the least amount of respect, I utterly despise HOAs). He&#8217;s going to show up to an <span class="caps">HOA</span> meeting with four foot printouts of my lawn, and there will be this deafening uproar of gasps and thuds as old women faint.</p>
<p>But then, a little girl with red hair will say &#8220;But wait! That&#8217;s not the same lawn I see every day! That lawn is vibrant, full of life, and fit for the finest of lawn sports, such as lawn bowling and lawn darts. You&#8217;re <b>mean</b> man!&#8221;</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">HOA</span> meeting will empty onto the streets, marching to my lawn, and all will gasp once again, only this time, because the little girl was right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a lot of anticipation, Carrie and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a> a weekend or two ago and were completely baffled about why it&#8217;s been getting good reviews. Seriously, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a very good movie.</p>
<p>To me, a good movie accomplishes at least two things: it exposes me to something I have little knowledge of, like a sub culture, or freakish human behavior, a religion, a sport, or something that piques my interest. The story has to engage me, either by making me laughing, making me think, tricking me, or tieing me up emotionally. If it can teach me something about human nature along the way, I give bonus points.</p>
<p>The second requirement is that it has to be a finely crafted movie. The writing has to be good, the cinematography has to be good, the editing, the score, the title screens. Every detail surrounding the movie has to convince me that a huge amount of talent and hard work went into making the movie, and that the interest of those behind the movie wasn&#8217;t simply to get my money &#8211; it was to make a good movie.</p>
<p>Lost in Translation doesn&#8217;t really meet either of those requirements for me. I think the character development is shallow, and only slightly interesting. The acting itself isn&#8217;t bad per se, but there&#8217;s really nothing there. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson just sort of allude to some sort of depth, but never fully get into it.</p>
<p>The city of Tokyo is obviously a character in the film, but again, it&#8217;s not portrayed as being a deeply intricate and complicated character. While the city is portrayed as colorful and vibrant, the focus still remains on the main characters, and the city itself seems to be robbed of the depth that could have been portrayed.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t feel like a mountain of talent went into making the movie. I don&#8217;t think the look of the movie is all that interesting, and for the most part looks like standard movie fare. There are some moments where the composition of the frame looks interesting, but could be better, deeper.</p>
<p>I respect also that the movie could have been designed to be as free of depth as it is, but I suspect it wasn&#8217;t because there are too many moments where it tries to get deep but fails. The pivotal conversation on the bed where Bill Murray&#8217;s character reveals that &#8220;life is hard, but you end up having kids that turn into the most delightful people you will ever meet&#8221; is about the deepest the movie gets.</p>
<p>Roger, I have to give this movie a thumbs down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m still puzzled by what I saw at <a href="http://www.rosesdeli.com/">Rose&#8217;s</a> this evening. To my immediate left sat a young couple, maybe late teens, early twenties. The girl said &#8220;So what are we going to do about this situation?&#8221; and then both proceeded to have a staring contest. For nearly two minutes without blinking. In a staring contest, two minutes is an eternity.</p>
<p>When the contest stopped, they chit chatted about other things not so interesting, but then I again noticed that a staring contest was in full force. Thinking that two staring contests back to back was too bizarre, I settled on another theory: narcoleptics. These people must have met at some narcoleptic support group, and have been spending so much time together that their narcoleptic fits are synchronized. Right as they&#8217;re taking a bite of ham on pumpernickle, zonk, they&#8217;re in a trance. Two minutes later, all is back to normal.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t settle so easily on this theory had I not known a friend who would do similar things. It&#8217;s kind of weird, really, in junior high I had a friend who was really into skateboarding. Destined to be a great. This kid was a rough kid too, strong as an ox and would frequently beat up other kids for sport. In one of those sporting events, he got kicked in the head very hard. Ended up with permanent brain damage. From that moment on, two things changed in my friend. He became a cowboy. Overnight, he&#8217;d gone from wearing Vision Streetwear to a cowboy boots, in Huntington Beach (Surf City <span class="caps">USA</span> dudes). And, more curiously, he&#8217;d clinically die every so often.</p>
<p>Really, all of his body functions would stop for about two or three minutes quite randomly. You&#8217;d be asking him how his day of cleaning stalls had gone, and he&#8217;d be saying &#8220;I helped shoe six [zonk]&#8221; and he was silent, quiet as a mouse for two minutes then &#8220;horses and swept somethin&#8217; like twenty stalls.&#8221; The first time it happened, his parents called 911, and before the ambulance got there he was perfectly fine. By the fifth or sixth time they stopped worrying about it, and if anyone witnessed it for the first time, there was always someone there to explain that he&#8217;d been kicked in the head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <b>always</b> want to pick up hitchhikers but never do. I see them as potential story goldmines, rich with tales that will make my head spin. Why are they there in the first place? Where are they going? What on earth motivated them to stick their thumb out in the air? What&#8217;s with the fleshy lobe hanging off their face and the constant hip scratching?</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m never willing to take the chance that they might want to strangle me or show me something unpleasant. I wish I had some kind of radar gun that told me if someone was just tired of walking, or if someone was really off their kangaroo.</p>
<p>Or an ejector seat. I could pull over and tell them to hop in. I&#8217;d give each one an orientation. &#8220;Welcome to my ride. By getting into my vehicle, you accept the fact that your seat is wired with high explosives, and should you do anything untowards to the driver, any occupants, or the car itself, the vehicle will automatically send you into outerspace. Thank you. Enjoy the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the radar gun would be less expensive, but you never know. An ejector seat would catch those who would otherwise be considered safe but would go bonkers after getting in my vehicle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most enjoyable times I had in England was the spur of the moment boat rental on the Thames. The morning started lazily &#8211; it was already hot that day, and because architecture in England is designed for cooler climates, the little 21 Holmanleaze was already sticky and hot. Only occasionally did a warm, round, breeze float through from the windows in the front room, pushed open as far as they&#8217;d go, trying to capture any air cooler or moving faster than the air inside. We&#8217;d always second guess ourselves, wondering if the windows were open all the way, and go give the white vinyl clad frames of double paned glass another fruitless push.</p>
<p>We needed to get out of the house, which was greedily lapping up every ray of heat directed at it. We needed to get out of the house because in its rooms that could be remembered by the size of the beds that occupied their entire floor space, there were also six people, three of which were visiting from the States, one of which was a teething baby learning how to walk, and the other two, tired of the stifling heat.</p>
<p>I thumbed through the English yellow pages, looking for boat hire establishments. I&#8217;d learned the lingo by now, and I knew I&#8217;d find nothing under boat rentals. The English are as fond of their vehicles as they are of people, which is why you can hire a boat, scooter, or person for that matter. Ask anyone for directions to the Car Rental place and you&#8217;ll be sucsessful only at befuddling the askee with your foreign devil tongue.</p>
<p>I phoned Maidenhead Boat Hire (had I called, I&#8217;d have shown up in person), and spoke in a perfect British accent. Or at least that&#8217;s what I was told by those within earshot. It wasn&#8217;t my intention to speak English to this man, but the situation couldn&#8217;t be helped. When in Mexico, I pick up a Mexican accent. When in England, I pick up an English accent. Had I been living in Iceland, I can say with most confidence that I would pick up an Icelandic accent.</p>
<p>But, despite what others told me, I was self concious about my American dialect when speaking to British people on the phone. Especially when it came to negotiating a price. Despite the nearly twice as valuable British Pound compared to the American dollar, I was convinced that when conducting a tourist type of activity, I would be taken advantage of based on my country of origin. Perhaps, deep within whatever twisted mazes of nerves and nuerons in my lobes, I was persuaded to mask my nationality to get what I wanted. A boat.</p>
<p>Maidenhead Boat Hire was out of stock. In our planning, we assumed this might happen. It was a Saturday in England, and it was nearing 11:00am. We&#8217;d be lucky, if anything, to find anyone in the entire United Kingdom who could accomodate our tardiness in planning the most important day of the week.</p>
<p>In what may have been a entirely American thing to do, I asked Maidenhead Boat Hire to give me the numbers of his competitors. With what I detected to be some reluctance in his voice, the man on the other end gave me the phone numbers to several boat hire establishments up and down river from our location, and suggested that I&#8217;d have a hard time finding a boat this late in the day, and that I should book a trip for next weekend with him instead.</p>
<p>His suggestion was just a bluff, because one of his competitors, down river from us, had a boat, and let me secure it with my American credit card immediately.</p>
<p>And so, we also left immediately. Had we stayed any longer, one of us would have combusted, alarming the neighbors who would then, out of confusion, yell at their dogs.</p>
<p>Six of us squeezed into a British sized vehicle, with a child seat in the back. Surely we were breaking laws, both physical and National. But our destiny was to motor the open waters of the River Thames, with the soft, warm breeze in our hair, our feet dragging in the water, tipping our hats to men on horses in Royal Gardens.</p>
<p>We arrived at the boat hire dock late, having gotten lost en route. It could have been worse, considering that we were both lost, and stuck in severe traffic due to some weekly event in the village we were trying to find.</p>
<p>Within minutes, we had a powerboat under our feet on top of the green river. The air was cool, soothing our tormented bodies. We had no plans but to keep moving in any direction.</p>
<p>The boat was a fine machine. Obviously, it had travelled countless miles on the river. It was weathered accordingly. Vinyl cushions with matching piped seams covered marine grad plywood benches adjacent to the sides of the hull, the cushions prohibiting the benches from drying completly, the wood not wet, yet cool and dark. Beneath the benches were places to store rope, spike, and a hammer to moor up to grassy banks.</p>
<p>The diesel engine of the machine was designed to travel at a maximum speed of 5 miles per hour. The pistons fired so lazily that you could hear your breath between each pop of combustion. The intensity of the engine set the mood for the day.</p>
<p>My memory of where we motored has left me, but there were locks to navigate through, and swans to avoid. Making it through a lock was the most terryfing thing I&#8217;ve ever done. Surrounded by yachts costing more than I&#8217;d make in a lifetime, I had to literally learn the ropes while navigating a boat for the first time. I expected that the little orange boat we hired would break free, spear an expensive vessel, and sink, taking the whole lot to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>The day was supremely satisfying. We waved at people, napped on the front of the boat, stopped for lunch, watched kids jump from a train bridge into the river. It was worth whatever insane inflated price we were charged.</p>
<p>So, several weeks later, Carrie and I did it again. But it was wholly uninteresting the second time, and I lost a pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: only go on a boat trip on the River Thames once, or you&#8217;ll lose your sunglasses.</p>
