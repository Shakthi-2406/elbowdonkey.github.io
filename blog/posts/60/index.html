<p>Certain thoughts might occur when looking at this photo of a US Special Forces soldier involved somehow in protecting the newly appointed Afghani president from a possible <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/09/05/afghan.assassination.attempt/index.html" target="_self">assasination attempt</a><p>. Guess what&nbsp;my first thought&nbsp;was:</p><br />
<p>a. That&#8217;s a fancy looking gun he has there.<br />b. How do they keep their dark vehicles so spotless in a dusty desert?<br />c. Wow, this guy is something else, he might have just saved a life.<br />d. I&#8217;m looking at quite a farmers tan here, and if not for that gun, I&#8217;d be seeing man boobs and beer gut.</p><br />
<p>If you picked answer <em>c</em>, you&#8217;re wrong. Dead wrong. The order of thoughts was, <em>d</em>, <em>a</em>, and <em>b</em>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Within a month I will be a parent for the first time. Eight months ago I was apprehensive, perhaps scared. Today, I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about what kind of parent I will be, and what kind of parents I have, and I&#8217;m not afraid. I&#8217;m well aware of the trials I face, and I&#8217;m glad that my life has been full of them so that I might grow accustomed to getting up after a fall. If children learn by example, my children have a lot to gain. I&#8217;ll teach them to follow me with a notepad, making sure&nbsp;I hit my quota of mistakes for the day.</p>
<p>My Dad has been pointing out that my priorities will change with a child, claiming that what was once important will be less so, and what wasn&#8217;t as important will become intensely desired. Maybe there&#8217;s something in the water, but I think he&#8217;s right. As it turns out, my Dad has always been right, and so has my Mom. What seemed like pure and utter insanity to sixteen year old ears is quite simply pure and simple truth.</p>
<p>I thought that with a child, the intensity at which I drum up business would be insane. My&nbsp;current&nbsp;&#8220;business-man&#8221; drive is largely driven by the desire to provide for my family, or the future of my family. But now, even as opportunities surface, I&#8217;m more concerned about having free time so that I can be there for my family. The memories I have of being a kid with my Dad are rich, and powerful, and despite the fact that he and my mom divorced when I was two, he was able to provide what no amount of money can purchase. He was and is&nbsp;a Dad, and a good one at that, and he&#8217;ll teach me everything I know about being a father.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the <a href="http://www.skateoregon.com/Aumsville/Aumsville.html" target="_self">Brian Haney Memorial Skatepark</a><p>&nbsp;today and had a lot of fun. I also came home with a wound the size of a fist on my right cheek (where the sun only sometimes shines).</p><br />
<p>I took a picture of it for science. Feel free to <a href="hipper.cfm" target="_self">look</a> at it. My goodies aren&#8217;t showing or anything. What you see is a picture of my upper thigh, white as ever, and looking simply massive due to camera angle.</p><br />
<p>It&#8217;s also worthy to note that this is mild compared to some of the hippers I&#8217;ve seen in my life on other people. But this is also a fresh hipper, and could change it&#8217;s appearance rapidly, displaying many hues of injurious colors.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m either going to learn how to cook today, or I&#8217;m going to starve to death. I can&#8217;t stomach another Wendy&#8217;s burger, or any more nachos from Taco Bell. I have to dive right in and make myself some good wholesome food. Normally, <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/carrie" target="_self">Carrie</a> <p>cooks. It&#8217;s not an old fashioned thing, she just has a talent for it. She&#8217;s the type who can look at a recipe, and decide how she wants to change it to suit her needs, or just come up with something on the fly. That&#8217;s as mysterious and amazing to me as I wish software engineering were to her (frankly, I don&#8217;t think she cares much about software engineering, other than the fact that it pays the bills).</p><br />
<p>Carrie is in California while I&#8217;m in Oregon. As always, our life is jumping all over the place. She&#8217;s in her ninth month of pregnancy, she&#8217;s selling our condo, getting ready to move, and getting ready for the new baby. You can&#8217;t help but think we&#8217;re insane sometimes.</p><br />
<p>Since she&#8217;s been gone I&#8217;ve lost about ten pounds according to the scales at Fry&#8217;s. I have a very high metabolism and gain/lose up to five pounds all the time, but I know I&#8217;m not getting the food or nutrition I need, so it&#8217;s time for action. I&#8217;m going to use <a href="http://www.karensrecipes.com/">http://www.karensrecipes.com/</a> to start my planning mainly because it&#8217;s the first place that comes to mind, it being the recipe site of Aaron&#8217;s wife Karen. I&#8217;m going to plan a week of meals at a time, and I&#8217;m going to force myself to learn the tricks. In a years time, I&#8217;ll be on Iron Chef.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Mr. Buffington, would you be willing to get on a direct flight to Portland? It leaves the same time as your flight, and is nearly empty. You&#8217;d arrive an hour early, with no stops and lots of elbow room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, as long as my luggage gets on the flight with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No problem sir, we&#8217;ll take care of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight is late. I see my original flight take off on time. Waiting thirty extra minutes at John Wayne is an eternity; short runways stress planes, and the chances of mechnical failures are increased. The crowd at the gate increases.</p>
<p>Boarding starts, I&#8217;m at the very back of the plane, and I&#8217;m the first on. I watch as a family of six kids and a mother with &#8216;80s straight up bangs commands her husband to do various husband-like tasks that he&#8217;d probably think to do himself if he could hear himself think over her barks. He has a baby hanging on his arm, drool flowing onto every armrest of every seat on the left side of the plane.</p>
<p>The mother, decked out in Disneyland attire from head to toe, is a row away. She doesn&#8217;t even give me a chance to stand up, she simply climbs across me into the window seat. I&#8217;m in the middle. She&#8217;s still barking commands at her husband who is three rows ahead, on the opposite half of the plane. I&#8217;m itching for the doors to close so I can get a better seat.</p>
<p>The plane fills, the seat next to me is empty, I&#8217;m ready to take it. The last person boarding the plane is at least 450 pounds, if not more. The last seat on the plane that I can see is the seat next to me. I give up all hope of a perfectly comfortable flight.</p>
<p>I spend half of the flight with my right shoulder buried in the side of this enormous man. Exactly halfway through the flight, the woman next to me turns green. She motions to me and the big man that she needs to get out, but it&#8217;s too late. She stand, turns to her left (thank all that is holy), and explodes into a puking frenzy. It&#8217;s on the seat, it&#8217;s on the side of the plane, it&#8217;s probably in her ten inch bangs. It stinks, and I&#8217;m suddenly fighting the urge to puke, and hoping with intensity that the big man next to me has a strong stomach, as the smell of her big event invades my nose.</p>
<p>There are no empty seats on the plane. Not one.</p>
<p>Nearby passengers are not happy. Children are crying, &#8216;80s bangs looks like she&#8217;s charging up for a second round. The big man has stood up, wedged himself between the seats two rows up, and I directly in front of him. A male flight attendant with a serious lisp is saying with a new and sudden stutter &#8220;P-P-Please m-m-miss, let me help y-y-you to the l-l-lavatory.&#8221; Too late. She pukes right into her chair. McDonalds doesn&#8217;t digest well. I feel good for haven&#8217;t not eating there for nearly ten years, except for the time in England and that doesn&#8217;t count because British food is worse.</p>
<p>The last half of the flight is spent standing at row twenty four, a screaming toddler on my left, and a Vietnamese lady who has been told at least three times to stop painting her nails in the plane, and who has also demanded, and been granted,&nbsp;three packets of Tylenol.</p>
<p>The meal is cancelled due to the fact that the three flight attendants on board are now cleaning up puke. The rear lavatory is now off limits, and home to &#8217;80s bangs. Five minutes before landing, the seats and the walls are cleaner, and the seats&nbsp;have been covered in plastic. &#8217;80s bangs is required to sit in her seat, with me next to her, along with the big man to my right.</p>
<p>We land, I remove myself from that snapshot of hell, and find out that my luggage will arrive an hour later. Alaska Airlines owes me big.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve hit my boiling point. When I go to <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target=""><span class="caps">CNN</span></a><p>, I want new content. Daily. I don&#8217;t want to keep reading about the sixty-four <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/08/19/terror.tape.main/index.html" target="">tapes</a> they obtained that show in detail the Cunning of al Qaeda. </p><br />
<p>And why should I be worried that &#8220;officials&#8221; are surprised at the advanced training al Qaeda was/is undertaking to rock our world? I&#8217;m not an official, and by gum, the second I realized that all hell was breaking loose on September 11th, I pretty quickly made the assessment that whoever was behind this wasn&#8217;t a dummy. I assumed that whoever was responsible had given this considerable planning. Officials just now being surprised that al Qaeda made a bunch of &#8220;western style city replicas&#8221; to train in is absurd. It&#8217;s what you do when you&#8217;re at war, especially when the enemy doesn&#8217;t know their at war yet.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>This continued &#8220;astonishment&#8221; aggravates the fact that <span class="caps">CNN</span> hasn&#8217;t reported anything interesting in the last few days. Dogs got gased. Western style building replicas. Osama has body guards. Officials are dumbfounded and stupified. Al Qaeda minions are smart. Chemical weapons very real. Blah.</p><br />
<p>And <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archived.blah/8/01/2002#960" target="">Matt</a>, I&#8217;m sorry, but I think the stories about the tapes have little to do with Mr. Bush and his War on Terrorism or the War on Iraq: Part II. <span class="caps">CNN</span> thinks they have something to milk, and I say its getting close to spoiling.</p></p>
