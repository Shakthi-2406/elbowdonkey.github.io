  <div class="entry-content"><p>In two frenzied nights of building I managed to frame up the entire halfpipe. It&#8217;s solid as a rock too. The flat bottom has 26 joists in a 6&#215;8 foot area. That&#8217;s nearly solid wood. The transitions have quite a few joists as well, making them pretty solid. I&#8217;m almost considering adding one or two more just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be covering the ramp starting tonight or tomorrow when my brother gets into town for a visit. Before I do that though, I think I&#8217;ll take Matt&#8217;s advice and put some sound insulation in. He suggested foam egg crate, but I was thinking of using that 1&quot; pink foam insulation that Home Depot sells. I can cut it to fit between the joists, and in the open transition areas, cover the floor as well. Before putting down the skin is the only chance I have at doing it, so I better decide soon, or resign to living with a noiser ramp.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2005/03/30/wordpres.shtml">Andy found out</a> that <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> had a ton of articles obviously written solely for the high paying ads they would attract, taking advantage of Wordpress&#8217; high page rank to increase their rankings in search results. This is something I&#8217;m familiar with and in fact, Andy mentions Asbestos Blog in his entry.</p>
<p>I feel like it&#8217;s important to point out what I think is a fairly big distinction between what <a href="http://asbestos.stinkmachine.com">Asbestos Blog</a> is doing and what Matt, the head honcho behind Wordpress, is doing. With Asbestos Blog, I know that despite the fact that I&#8217;m trying to attract high paying ads (something both Matt and I are doing) I also know that I cannot succeed by any means if I don&#8217;t accomplish two things: I absolutely must have real content that I&#8217;ve personally written myself, and I must produce that content several times per day. I&#8217;m failing on the second half*. Doing this makes my site a blog versus a link farm. I&#8217;m sure to get flak from that, but I&#8217;ll stand by my opinion, and more specifically say this:</p>
<p>Matt is running a link farm, or more accurately, hosting a link farm.</p>
<p>Matt isn&#8217;t producing the content. A third party is producing content that is obviously designed to be eaten up by Google. What some people see as terrible writing and grammar I see as a cleverly designed piece of content. It&#8217;s dry and horrible because it&#8217;s not meant for human consumption. It&#8217;s meant to trick Google&#8217;s language parsing into thinking there is real, human generated content that other humans will be interested in, when in truth only the former might be true.</p>
<p>The very fact that a third party is willing to provide Matt with content and pay him a flat rate for the privilege of using his blog further suggests that someone is trying to game the system and that it&#8217;s working. I&#8217;m even confident in saying that Matt is getting ripped off &#8211; if he could do this himself, he&#8217;d be making a lot more money, but that&#8217;s a very tangential topic.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction between Asbestos Blog and Matt&#8217;s Wordpress pages is that Matt is simply hosting someone&#8217;s link farm and licensing out his sweet Google page rank in exchange for money. Personally, I think it&#8217;s cheap, but not unethical like a lot of people are suggesting, Andy included.</p>
<p>At first I thought &#8211; &#8220;This is an open source project. People are donating their time, money, and efforts into making a good product with no compensation. This ain&#8217;t right!&#8221; My first thought was that open source projects should be like non-profits, and that it stunk to not disclose spending or income sources.</p>
<p>But then, there are no rules like that governing open source projects. If you donate code, you do so without compensation. If the head honcho makes tons of money off the project he&#8217;s not obligated to cut you in on the deal, or even tell you about it. Showing a bit of good will and returning to the community that helped build the project is a nice idea and will go far, but it&#8217;s certainly not the rule.</p>
<p>I think the link farm bit is shady simply because it&#8217;s pure gaming of Google, plain and simple. Asbestos Blog does no gaming &#8211; I have no page rank to give it any advantage. I follow the rules of &#8220;content is king&#8221;. If my entries show up high in search results it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re relevant, not because they&#8217;re linked to buy a high page rank site**.</p>
<p>But, I also think Matt can do whatever he like with his page rank. Whether or not that will help or hinder his project is a whole other story, but certainly you cannot call him unethical.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A full report of the progress of Asbestos Blog is forthcoming.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: several high page ranked sites, including Boing Boing, Slashdot, and other bloggers linked to this site, which then linked to Asbestos Blog itself. The page ranks of those sites definitely had an impact for about a week, but that no long seems to be the case. And I never set out to use page rank to further my means initially, which is part of my point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago I found some <a href="http://www.rickdahlen.com/hpplans/plans.html">great free halfpipe plans</a>. I&#8217;m using those plans as the foundation for my design, which will be modified slightly to be a bit shorter. I don&#8217;t have the advantage of width or height in the space I&#8217;m building it, so I reason that a shorter deck will save me from putting my head through the ceiling, and also keep my speed down a bit, reducing my side to side requirements.</p>
<div class="googleAds" style="padding:15px;">
</div>
<p>Because it will be shorter, I&#8217;ve tightened the curve radius a bit as well. If I simply used the suggested 7.5 foot radius and cut off a foot from the top of the ramp, I&#8217;d have a very &#8220;soft&#8221; ramp, where the angle wouldn&#8217;t be close enough to vertical to feel like a real ramp at all. I&#8217;m using a curve radius of 6 feet. The angle on the 7.5 foot is about 60 degrees (90 being vertical), and with a 6 foot radius, I end up with an angle of about 55 degrees. Any smaller than 6 feet and the transition would likely be too tight to right, so that&#8217;s about as good as I&#8217;ll get.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be 8 feet wide, which again, isn&#8217;t that wide (another reason I&#8217;m calling this a micro pipe). But combined with the height of the ramp, I think it&#8217;s just fine. There will be 8 feet of flat bottom which might prove to be too much. With the smaller transitions, I have less opportunity to pump to maintain speed, and may lose it in the 8 feet. I&#8217;ll be able to shorten the flat bottom if it&#8217;s too much though, so I&#8217;m not worried about this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week we needed to get behind our TV which sits in a cubby above our fireplace. It took six healthy adults to put the TV there, and it wasn&#8217;t easy at that. The cubby is 51 inches above the ground (about chest high for me) and the TV weighed as much as two American elephants (home of the world&#8217;s heaviest).</p>
<p>The best way to get behind the TV would be slide it straight out onto a stand the same height as the mantle it sat on, do my business of fiddling with wires in the open space, then slide it back. Plans were drawn, miter saw was purchased, stand was built with perfect accuracy thanks to laser beams.</p>
<p>So this is when I started thinking. The miter saw proved to myself, and most importantly, Carrie, that I could make wooden structures with great accuracy. This could mean only one thing. Halfpipe.</p>
<p>Finally, after years of talking about it, I&#8217;m going to build myself a halfpipe. It&#8217;s going to be super micro sized because I want it to fit in my garage, but it will still be a halfpipe. It&#8217;s not going to sit outdoors because a) it&#8217;s always raining and b) if it&#8217;s not raining, I have the world&#8217;s best skateparks only minutes away. It being micro sized (only about 3 feet tall) will not be an issue when it&#8217;s pouring rain outside. On a technical level, the height doesn&#8217;t really matter. If you can do things on a 3 foot micro pipe you can do them on a 6 foot pipe (getting the courage to do it on a 6 foot is another issue entirely).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be documenting the process through photos, videos, and blog entries. I figure it will take me several evenings of cutting and assembly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Number of Times I&#8217;ve had the flu in a Super Bad kinda way: 2<br />
Number of Times I&#8217;ve had the flu in the same season as getting a flu shot: 2</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to listen to anyone anymore about whether or not flu shots are good or bad or harmless because they don&#8217;t contain live cultures or whatever. My record is pretty consistent, and I think I&#8217;m going to fend for myself and stick with plain old superstition next time.</p>
<p>When I arrived home from <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, both kids were infected with the Super Bad virus, the one that makes them deposit stomach packages all over the place and turns them into radiant heaters. They even had tip over alarms that took advantage of eons of genetic evolution, instilling intense desire in their parents to right them again so they wouldn&#8217;t burn up the floor.</p>
<p>Leah literally didn&#8217;t move for an entire day. We set her on the floor in front of the TV, and she remained in whatever pose we put her in (bedsore avoidance &#8211; can&#8217;t be too cautious) until we picked her up to put her in bed later that night. Jonas, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy puking, which is hardly a surprise. What he truly doesn&#8217;t enjoy is getting new teeth, which he transitioned to from puking without wasting a breath.</p>
<p>Once the kids were done Exorcising whatever we put in them I thought we were all clear. Then I got it, again. I say again because nearly the same thing happened a week or two before <span class="caps">SXSW</span>.</p>
<p>I lost 10 pounds in 24 hours. Picture me then think of the horror of ten less pounds. I always figured my bones made up the majority of my weight with my eyes and teeth making up the rest, but apparently my guts can shrink up into my rib cage in rapid order if persuaded by the Super Bad kinda flu.</p>
<p>Now picture me as George Costanza&#8217;s father at the <a href="http://www.karber.net/seinfeld/festivus/default.htm">Festivus</a> dinner table, aluminum pole in hand. Imagine there&#8217;s a human sized syringe at the table. If you know anything about Festivus, you know that after I scream my head off and air my grievances with the flu shot, I&#8217;ll challenge it to a feat of strength in which I&#8217;ll pin it to the ground and break it right in half. Now you know how serious I am.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple of hours getting to know Ruby over the course of a couple of weeks and I&#8217;m impressed, on a number of levels. First of all, the community is bigger than I expected. The Ruby Talk email list is very active, and newbies seem to be treated with respect. Second, Ruby is pretty intuitive and flexible &#8211; stuff works in a common sense sort of way (which is slightly odd when you&#8217;re used to more convoluted ways of doing things).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly reading <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/index.html">Programming Ruby &#8211; The Pragmatic Programers Guide</a> (which is available in its entirety online). The book is written well, and is easing me into the language slowly. The author assumes that the reader has some programming experience, so be forewarned if you&#8217;re just picking up Ruby as your first language.</p>
<p>A couple of people have emailed me asking how it compares to ColdFusion, and I have to admit there are quite a few similarities. Ruby is typeless just like ColdFusion. There are a lot of similarities in how objects are created and used within code. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find similar parallels as I progress.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> as my <span class="caps">IDE</span> for ColdFusion (it works on the Mac as well as PC, which I switch between pretty often) so I went out and found a <a href="http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/">Ruby plugin for Eclipse</a> that seems adequate. There&#8217;s no code hinting (I&#8217;m on the lookout for a plugin that does code hinting) but as you build your Ruby application the classes and methods are outlined in the outline view.</p>
<p>My next goal is to come up with a training application to write. I&#8217;m not used to straight command line stuff, having done web apps for so long, so I might just take it to my next goal which is to write a Ruby on Rails application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When my brothers and I were a lot younger, we would often sit down and try to make up the best &#8220;Old Man Saying&#8221; we could come up with, speaking it as an old man with thyroid problems or years of grumbling might. An Old Man Saying is something like &#8220;There&#8217;s more sheep there than you can shake a stick at&#8221; or &#8220;Better than a stick in the eye&#8221; or &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t touch that with a ten foot pole&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve noticed, there&#8217;s a theme emerging here. Sticks.</p>
<p>I have a theory about Old Man Sayings and sticks. Before technology turned everyone&#8217;s world upside down, the best thing going for you in life was a stick. You could scratch strategic plans in the dirt, kill rabbits, poke at things without bending over, and use it to scratch your back. To help flesh out this theory, here are several selected Old Man Sayings whose entomology must derive directly from what was then the killer app, the stick.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;More [objects] than you can shake a stick at.&#8221;<br />
While the practical nature of a stick is completely obvious, what we don&#8217;t know in this modern age is that wielding a stick can get tiring. If you have three hundred cats and you want to count them, you&#8217;d aim your stick at them and count them off. The part about &#8220;shaking a stick&#8221; comes from the fact that if you were counting three hundreds cats, your stick would be shaking from all the rapid counting. But doing so is tiring, so you&#8217;d just give up, and concede that there were more than you could count. Experience would teach you that you could never count three hundred cats, so as you stumbled upon them in your kilt, you&#8217;d be overwhelmed and say &#8220;Yeah, you know what, there are more cats there than I can shake a stick at.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Better than a stick in the eye.&#8221;<br />
In the old days as people were beginning to build up cities and live in them, loads of bricks would fall on passers by, killing them or breaking their bones. Those responsible for dropping the loads would call out to the victim &#8220;Hey man, that&#8217;s certainly better than a stick in the eye!&#8221; and the victim would agree, even if his bones were broken. This is because of the age old tradition of jabbing sticks in the eyes of your enemies as a form of humiliation. It would be better to be crippled and broken up by accident in those days than it would be to have your pride undermined by getting a stick in the eye.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t touch that with a [length] pole&#8221;<br />
Shortly after the adoption of the stick, a common misconception arose. Orange farmers would take a stick and poke at their crop, testing for ripeness. Some oranges would fall off, some would stay firmly. But some, in their putrid and rotten state, would leak foul rotten orange juice down the stick which would dribble on the stick holders hands and cravats. This would attract insects and wild predators. The assumption came pretty quickly that anything vile or putrid shouldn&#8217;t be touched with a stick due to it&#8217;s possible transfer capabilities.</p>
<p>I encourage you to find a stick in your yard and relive the Stick Era. These sayings I&#8217;ve talked about will certainly take on a whole new meaning. I encourage you to comment and add more stick related sayings so we can decipher their true meaning.</p>
