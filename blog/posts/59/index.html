  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I are sure of one thing. We&#8217;re complete and utter doughheads. Either it&#8217;s the lack of sleep, or the&nbsp;intense focus on the well being of our new child, but we&#8217;re suddenly stammering and stumbling through life.</p>
<p>We have a new appreciation for Ozzy and his ramblings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our first night home with Leah was splendid. Except for me being insane.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fully understandable that a new baby will wake up a few times in the night to feed, as Leah did. What&#8217;s not fully understandable is the strange dreams, or should I say, psychosis that two hour spans of sleep can produce in the night.</p>
<p>You see, there are these &#8216;possums that routinely walk the walls between houses in the neighborhood where Carrie and I are staying. It&#8217;s perfectly normal to wake up to the sound of a big boney &#8216;possum slowly making it&#8217;s way across the ivy covered wall next to our window at night.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not perfectly normal is to think that all human beings have pets that they nurse off of even into adulthood, and that Carrie&#8217;s preferred &#8220;pet&#8221; is the very &#8216;possum creeping outside our window. Everyone knows that &#8217;possums are ugly nasty things, and so when I heard that &#8217;possum making it&#8217;s rounds, I froze. In my mind, that &#8216;possum was half way up the side of our bed, making it&#8217;s way towards Carrie, and if just held still enough, it would feed her, and be on it&#8217;s way. I was willing to accept it might crawl right over me, but as long as I held perfectly still I wouldn&#8217;t have to see it&#8217;s ugly boney face.</p>
<p>It took me about ten minutes before I realized that it was not reality, and that I was lucky I hadn&#8217;t thought to go nuts and exterminate the &#8217;possum instead. No one needs to see my skinny white thighs in the middle of the night chasing a &#8217;possum down the street screaming &#8220;Go away damn dirty &#8217;possum. No one wants your foul milk!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/leah" target="_self">She&#8217;s here</a><p>. Carrie starting feeling some minor contractions Friday night. We took the dog for a walk, went to the grocery store to find Fudge Covered Mint Oreos, then, when contractions had continued for a while, called the doctor at 9:00pm&nbsp;to see if it was time. Doctor said no</p><br />
<p>At 2:30am, Leah said yes. Contractions were a lot stronger, and closer together, and I had to convince Carrie it was time to go in. She called the doctor, and the doctor said it was time. Six hours later, at 8:27am, Leah shot out like a rocket.</p><br />
<p>I heard it said before, that the moment you see your child for the first time is unique, and I&#8217;m now a believer.&nbsp;I thought it was merely routine, something parents said because it was what was normally said, but it&#8217;s far from that. It&#8217;s as special as special gets.</p><br />
<p>Leah&#8217;s site was tossed together in about 20 minutes. It will improve, and photos where her face isn&#8217;t mashed up from the birth will be available, as well as video clips. We need to settle in a bit (and leave the hospital) first.</p><br />
<p>Thanks to all those who have been asking and anticipating her arrival and thinking about us. She&#8217;s here!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, not too fast there partner. I thought it was time, but the baby seems to have other plans. No problem, it just gives us a little more time to put a site together for the actual announcement when she comes.</p>
<p>I was impressed by how fast I made it from Portland to Orange County. At 10:46am the decision was made to come home, and at 3:00pm I was standing curbside at John Wayne Airport waiting to be picked up. </p>
<p>Prior to flying, I had&nbsp;packed, moved as much of the Cort rental furniture into the living room of the Oregon Remote Headquarters as possible, and tidied up my cube at work.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have done it without the help of Al, my technical lead at Xerox. I hadn&#8217;t figured out how I&#8217;d get to the airport, but he had, and was ready to take me without my even asking. I intend to return the favor some day.</p>
<p>As far as news of the new arrival is concerned, we have a list of people to call, and for those who don&#8217;t get a call, we&#8217;ll be making the announcement here, so worry not!</p>

<p>From the sounds of things, I could be flying home any second, hopefully getting home before my wife needs to go to the hospital. According to family tradition (on her side), going into labor feels like bad gas, and if you don&#8217;t pay attention, the baby will be coming before you can blink an eye. This makes timing difficult when one is in Oregon and the other is in California.</p>
<p>I wrote a ColdFusion powered <span class="caps">WAP</span> site on my server that takes a single input. I connect via my Sprint <span class="caps">PCS</span>, push a button, and my blog is updated with a message saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s time.&#8221; When you see that, pray that I&#8217;m not living <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093748" target="_self">Plains Trains and Automobiles</a><p>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I read an awesome (awesome, as in, wow, this is insane) <a href="http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm" target="_self">article on DoS attacks</a> <p>originating from <span class="caps">IRC</span> servers. To those not technically inclined, let me give the skinny:</p><br />
<p>DoS means denial of service. Picture 500,000 people trying to get through a single door while running. Bad stuff is going to happen, mainly, the door is going to get blocked. This is similar to what a computer experiences during a DoS. A deliberately unhealthy amount of packets are sent to a computer, knocking it off the Internet.</p><br />
<p><span class="caps">IRC</span> means Internet Relay Chat. <span class="caps">IRC</span> servers sit out on the Internet, and allow people to chat with other users who connect to the same server. Sometimes, a lot of servers build bridges to eachother, providing a network of chat servers. If you connect to one server, you can talk to people on other servers within the network without having to jump through a bunch of hoops.</p><br />
<p>DoS attacks are started by people on <span class="caps">IRC</span> servers who have bots to do their bidding. These bots are programs that sit on a server somewhere that can connect to <span class="caps">IRC</span> servers just like a human would. They wait for keywords from their owner, and when called to action, unleash a fury of packets against their target (your computer).</p><br />
<p>The detail of <a href="http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm" target="_self">this article</a> is great, the guy goes to incredible lengths to track down and understand why he&#8217;s getting attacked by some unknown entity. The best part is when he breaks into a chat room of those who created the bots after spying on them for days. He knows enough about these guys to put them in prison for a long time, and he basically shakes their world up when he stops by for a little chat. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p><br />
<p>Having read this article, I&#8217;m a bit worried, namely because the hundreds of infected emails I get a day indicate that the bots know who I am, and consider my servers to be a good place to launch an attack from. My servers are patched, and the infected emails never get anywhere near executing, but it&#8217;s still a concern. I&#8217;ll be doing an intense security audit tonight, and will report tomorrow.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Xerox is an international company, and for the past week that has been more evident than ever as I&#8217;ve been working with two chaps from England who are working on the same project as me.</p>
<p>I know this will all come around to get me someday when I least expect it, but I&#8217;ve been taking serious advantage of the subtle differences between American English and &#8220;Queen&#8217;s English&#8221; as they put it, and different cultures in general. </p>
<p>For instance, when one asked &#8220;what do you call those?&#8221; while pointing at tater tots, &#8220;puffy lumps&#8221; seems like a good substitute to teach him. Baseballs are wrought iron with a leather cover, and the local Oregon marrionberrys are a type of tomato. Silly putty is a hair removal product, and jelly is the juice that comes out of the mustard bottle before the mustard actually comes out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve earned their mistrust, as they now think I&#8217;m making it up when I talk about a pickle in baseball. They&#8217;ll realize before too long that&nbsp;it wasn&#8217;t a&nbsp;joke, and will then have to trust that half the time I&#8217;m correct in what I teach them.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I plan on reinforcing that a restroom should actually be called the honey pot, ATM&#8217;s are called Warbucks, giving the bird while driving is encouraged, and giving pelvic thrusts is better than giving high fives.</p>
<p>I fear the day I land on British soil in their care.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting at midnight tonight this site will be offline for the duration of September 11th. No hype, no recollections of what is still a vivid memory, no special tribute. I&#8217;d like to come up with something sentimental, something that reflects my feelings about the day, but I fear I&#8217;d make it tacky, less important than the what the quiet remembrance of that day might produce instead.</p>
<p>Tomorrow should be a day to remember the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, a day to remember those who lost their lives trying to save the innocent, and those who carried out the act that hurt so many so deeply.</p>
