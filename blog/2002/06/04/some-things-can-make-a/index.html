<div class="entry-content"><p>Some things can make a grown man cry, and I mean this with the utmost sincerity. I mentioned the other day that someone had stolen my skateboard, and how upset I was about it.</p>
<p>About ten or twenty minutes ago&nbsp;I was finishing up some changes on a new ColdFusion tutorial. My attention was undivided towards finishing the article. I&#8217;d had been struggling with it for some time, and was highly focused on&nbsp;getting it done so I could go to sleep. My office is pretty dark as was the rest of the house. Carrie had gone to sleep early. </p>
<p>Around 10:45PM I started getting paranoid, thinking I&#8217;d heard a noise on the porch. It&#8217;s not abnormal to hear noise; we share a staircase with my neighbor and he often comes home around this time, but since someone had just stolen from me I was a bit on edge, assuming they might come back to take my shoes this time (they might be worth something to someone, they&#8217;re basically my &#8220;work on dirty stuff&#8221; shoes and are worth little to me now, but they had their day in the sun). </p>
<p>Just as I was figuring out where the nearest phone was in case I had to call an ambulance for whoever was brave enough to make a second visit, woodpecker-like noises started coming from my aquarium. Now, I have two saltwater reef aquariums in my office which I&#8217;ll talk about another time, but in one, a particular hermit crab has a certain habit of humping the other hermit crabs in a machine-gun-like fashion. It&#8217;s pretty noisy business. Since I was so deep in my work, I figured the noises I&#8217;d heard were due to this love machine hermit crab.</p>
<p>I posted the article, wrote a blog entry about it, closed my laptop, stood up to go hit the sack, and thought I better check the office window to make sure it was locked. Through the blinds, I caught a glimpse of a shiny new skateboard. Heart attack. Confusion. The noises I had heard actually were from someone coming to my porch, not Humping Hermit, but this time the noises were from something I could have never guessed.</p>
<p>Some things can make a grown man cry.</p>
<p>It took me about thirty minutes to reach out and pick it up. Like Willy Wonka and the golden ticket, I didn&#8217;t believe it. It wasn&#8217;t until I got a call from &#8220;George&#8221; who claimed he was instructed to call me and was told to tell me to &#8220;look down on your porch&#8221; that I actually opened the door and picked it up. When asked who he really was he said &#8220;I&#8217;m not at liberty to tell, just following instructions, and besides, you wouldn&#8217;t know me anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sincere thanks to whoever did this. Now I need to go pay it forward.</p>
