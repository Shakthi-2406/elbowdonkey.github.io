<p>Now <strong>that</strong> <p>is a headline. By the way, I have a reef aquarium on my desk at work, and I will every so often take pictures of it to help judge growth rates and things like that.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a dream that other night that I had two heads. I wasn&#8217;t suprised by the extra head, it was something I&#8217;d lived with my entire life. There were some cools things about having an extra head, which I&#8217;ll list now:</p>
<ul>
<li>My other head had different tastes for food. It liked sushi, I liked Mexican food.</li>
<li>I could take a nap while my other head took care of the driving.</li>
<li>I could watch television while my other head read a book.</li>
<li>While swimming, one head could get air, while the other one visited the fantastic world of underwater sights.</li>
<li>Catching a ball without hands was easy. We just put our heads together.</li>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=colloquialism">colloquialism</a> <p>&#8220;Put your heads together&#8221; made more sense, after catching balls and Frisbees.<br />
<p>There were some disadvantages too which might dissuade one from wanting an extra head, so I&#8217;ll be brief. The number one disadvantage was jealously. Either it was jealous of me kissing my wife, or I was jealous of it kissing my wife when left&#8217;s and right&#8217;s were confused. Buying extra pillows was also a chore, and while you might think two would do, you&#8217;d be wrong, because three are required (one for in between the heads).</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting deeper and deeper into learning Cascading Style Sheets to help clean up a lot of my web projects, and just found an online tool that helps me understand how some of the more complex style sheets work, and what they mean.</p>
<p>The tool, called the <span><a target="_blank" href="http://penguin.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py">Selectoracle</a><p><span>, let&#8217;s you paste some <span class="caps">CSS</span> code into the box, and it will tell you in plain English what the style definitions actual do. This, in my opinion, is an extremely valuable tool for learning by example.</span></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a free little utility that is a dream come true. I&#8217;ve always hated PhotoShop&#8217;s color picker, especially the &#8220;Copy Color as <span class="caps">HTML</span>&#8221; part. Rather than simply copy the hex value (which is the only thing important to me), it copies a &#8220;<span class="caps">COLOR</span>=&#8217;#<span class="caps">FFFFFF</span>&#8221; string which just sucks. First of all, the all caps <span class="caps">COLOR</span> sucks because I don&#8217;t code in uppercase, and I usually end up just deleting it anyways because I&#8217;m sticking the color into a style sheet.</p>
<p>So, in trying to find a way to hack PhotoShop, I ran across a program called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.html">Pixie</a><p>. Pixie sits in the corner of your screen, and reports the color that is directly under the tip of the cursor, in PhotoShop or out. Pressing <span class="caps">CTRL</span> + <span class="caps">ALT</span> + C copies the <span class="caps">HTML</span> friendly string without any other crap, just a plain <span class="caps">FFFFFF</span> style string. I&#8217;m in love with this program. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s tiny, and I has some other cool features that I haven&#8217;t mentioned.</p><br />
<p>Also in the news, <a target="" href="http://people.cedarville.edu/Student/s1270113/">man builds a rollercoaster</a> in his backyard. <a target="" href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> picked it up first, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t talk about it now does it? I will do this someday, along with my go cart racing track, my sky diving silo, and my cadillac catapult.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having a pickup truck means moving furniture for friends and family. The dealer doesn&#8217;t mention this when you&#8217;re in the dealership becoming intoxicated with the new car smell. It doesn&#8217;t help to say &#8220;Hey, everyone will call you up and say &#8216;can you move my refrigerator?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually not that common of an occurance, but it does happen more often than one might think. But enough of that, I&#8217;m poorly trying to segway into a story about last night. When I was moving furniture last, I used some blankets to keep the furniture safe from dings and scratches.</p>
<p>As I normally do for just about everything, I neglected the blankets until last night, at which point I thought it would be a good idea to put the blankets in the garage in case it rained. So I went downstairs to my truck, grabbed one of the blankets, then grabbed the other and was immediately confronted with a huge hissing &#8217;possum.</p>
<p>For those that have never met a &#8216;possum, they&#8217;re like giant ugly greasy rats. We&#8217;re talking small dog size, and the bigger they are, the nastier they are.</p>
<p>Needless to say I almost had a heart attack. I decided to let the &#8217;possum continue hanging out in the back of my truck, and let the tail gate down for him to help make his departure an easy one.</p>
<p>He was gone this morning, so I assume he moved on. I&#8217;m not sure how long he&#8217;d been there. It&#8217;s quite possible he was hanging out in the back of my truck for more than just a few hours, maybe a few days. Who knows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve gone over a week without skateboarding. I took a pretty big hit the night I decided to take a break. I can&#8217;t remember exactly what happened, I just remember that at one point I was sliding on my chin, my ribs, right shoulder, and my hip in a synchronized motion across pavement.</p>
<p>I always wear a helmet and it has served it&#8217;s purpose in the past, but this time it wasn&#8217;t helping at all. This is exactly what I was thinking mid face slide. &#8220;This helmet isn&#8217;t doing a darn thing to change my current situation.&#8221; Once my transition from one section of concrete to another was complete it was time to assess the damage.</p>
<p>The first thing one must do after falling from a skateboard is to immediately stand up. This will tell you a few things about your condition &#8211; things you may not be aware of. For example, if when standing up, you actually simply remain on the ground, something is wrong anywhere from the neck down. If you stand up, but immediately assume a prone position once&nbsp;again, this means something from the waste down is malfunctioning. If a full stand up is achieved, one must immediately check the arms and hands. Bend all fingers, perfom commonly used gestures, rotate arms, bend all joints.Waiting 5 minutes is also advised, as bleeding from abrasions can take some time to notice.</p>
<p>That night I stood up. Nothing wrong in the lower extremities, hip swell was confirmed, but that&#8217;s a common occurance. Rib abrasions are new, as are chin and shoulder abrasions. These would make for a new experience, and new reasons for my wife not to like skateboarding. I was expecting these wounds, having had time to think about it mid slide.</p>
<p>What I wasn&#8217;t expecting was a pickled pinky. When checking out the arms and hands, it became apparent that someone had replaced the pinky finger on my left hand with a pickle. I looked back on the recent event, and concurred that at no time did anyone have the opportunity to replace my pinky finger &#8211; it was unsolved mysteries time.</p>
<p>Apparently something bad happened to my pinky &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t replaced afterall, merely swollen to the size of a Vlasic Classic Dill Pickle.&nbsp;My educated guess is that in the process of overcoming&nbsp;friction between my body and concrete, my hand was contorted somehow in a way that was disagreeable to it&#8217;s sensibilities.</p>
<p>So now, a week later, the swelling is gone, but something is wrong with my finger, or I should say hand. I&#8217;ve ruled out broken bones in the part of my finger that extends off my hands, but the bones that go deeper into my mitt are of unknown status. I also think that&nbsp;the &#8220;guts&#8221; between my pinky finger and my ring finger are having some issues. I&#8217;m considering spending the $50.00 copay to get it checked out at the hospital, or wait for an appointment with my doctor for $10.00. </p>
<p>The point of the story &#8211; nothing. Just remember Pickled Pinky.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Five minutes ago I felt that death was a sure thing. No joke. I was moving around in my laundry room, and in doing so knocked a Dust Buster&nbsp;(little rechargable vacuum cleaner)&nbsp;off a shelf. It fell into an area in the laundry room that consists mainly of natural gas lines and valves and things. It&#8217;s a crowded little space, and getting to it is even more difficult because of where the washer and dryer sit.</p>
<p>The Dust Buster fell, hitting something very hard, and immediately I begin to hear the sound of a ruptured pipe. &quot;Oh crap! I just broke a gas line, and that rushing sound of air is the gas, what in the hell do I do? Am I going to suffocate here while I try to figure out what&#8217;s broken, and then when they come to find me after I&#8217;ve been missing for days the house will explode when someone flips a switch? If I move will I create static electricity and spark an explosion? That pipe seems to be moving a lot of gas, I <strong>must</strong> <p>do something. Who do I call? 911? Yes, my house could explode if I don&#8217;t do something, this isn&#8217;t trivial. But maybe I&#8217;m mistaken, let me take another look into the valve pit. I&#8217;m a handy guy, I can fix it. I&#8217;m going to die. My house is going to explode. <strong>Do something!</strong>&quot;</p><br />
<p>So I open a the a large sliding glass door, then run back to the laundry room determined to shut off the leak. &#8220;Has the gas flow increased? I can&#8217;t tell. There must be a main shutoff, I think that&#8217;s it &#8211; it won&#8217;t budge, but maybe that&#8217;s not it anyways. It sounds like a fan, maybe there&#8217;s an exhaust fan. I hear a fan, maybe it&#8217;s not gas and it&#8217;s just a fa&#8230; the <strong>Dust Buster</strong>.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>That&#8217;s right. The Dust Buster hard turned itself on in the process of falling. The sound was not a pipe spewing deadly flammable gas after all, merely the motor of a machine that had been charging probably since we moved into this place. I didn&#8217;t even realize it had any juice in it. When I turned off the Dust Buster my heart began to pound. I had just finished watching The Chair gameshow for the first time. The object is to keep your heartrate below a certain level while answering a question. If the heartrate goes too high, you lose x amount of dollars per second until it comes back&nbsp;down. When watching it, we noticed that some people had very low heartrates during the question asking, and much higher ones immediately after getting a question correct.</p><br />
<p>I think I had my own &#8220;Chair&#8221; experience this evening, one that I care not repeat anytime soon. The term &#8220;life flashed before my eyes&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be any more true.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent some time looking at my log files and I realize now that there are a ton of people linking to this here site. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool, and following the lead of <a href="http://www.joemaller.com/" target="">Joe Maller</a><p>, I&#8217;m going to begin linking back to all the fine folks who link to me. I think it&#8217;s interesting that people find me interesting enough to want to check out my blog. Now the pressure is on to keep the content fresh.</p><br />
<p>With that said, let me tell a story.</p><br />
<p>Now, before I begin let me mention that I&#8217;m not one who normally curses on my site or in conversation. So consider this a rare and precious moment -&nbsp;asshole. The first time I heard this word it sent me into a fit of four year old thought.</p><br />
<p>I was at pre-school swinging on the swings beside some kid. I remember that he was kind of pushy, and wasn&#8217;t someone I felt comfortable hanging with, so I usually avoided him. While on the swings, his intentions were to jump off the swing, but someone was in his landing zone so he yelled &#8220;Get out of the way asshole&#8221;. My&nbsp;four year old brain was clever. Having never heard this word it quickly began to determine the meaning. Simple: ass, well, that&#8217;s short for asphalt, and asphalt comes from volcanoes, so asshole is the opening of a volcano. What a stupid insult. Dumb kid.</p></p>
