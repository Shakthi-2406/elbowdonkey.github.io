  <div class="entry-content"><p>Found an <a href="http://www.animateclay.com/" target="">interesting tutorial</a> <p>on stop motion clay animation. I remember in the late 80&#8217;s Will Vinton came out with a bunch of very well done Claymation movies. I remember also seeing a documentary about Will Vinton, and thought it was incredible the amount of work that goes into clay animation. I guess it still takes a lot of work.</p><br />
<p>This also reminds me of the game <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/0,11114,198975,00.html" target="">The Neverhood</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There a few machines I&#8217;d like invented:</p>
<p>I want a true diaper genie (place kid in/on machine, machine changes diaper, no smell, crying, no mess).</p>
<p>I want something that will whip up a quesadilla in no time flat, and make a big ruckus while doing so.</p>
<p>I want a haircutting maching, but it has to do it&#8217;s business while I sleep, as I&#8217;m not to be bothered with hair related items.</p>
<p>I could go for a machine that would take care of junk mail in my house, and turn it into something useful, like logs, or furniture, or maybe just squeeze the mail into oblivion, so I can have unnaturally heavy pellets. Imagine that, a machine that makes 5 pound pellets in the size of a marble. That would be something.</p>
<p>And maybe a machine that follows me around, anticipating my inevitable sitting down mode. It would be&nbsp;like a little chair. I&#8217;d never have to worry about falling down, I&#8217;d just begin the process of sitting down, and the machine would rise to meet my sitting parts. I could completely remove the &#8220;must have chair before sitting down&#8221; condition from my brain, because this machine would always be there, just as air is always there to breath.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I love about being able to write code. In the computer world, I can whip these &#8220;machines&#8221; up. If I need something done, I just think of it, and I can see the code in my head. Maybe if I knew how to mold plastic, solder circuit boards, and construct physically sound structures I&#8217;d be able to have my SitSit<sup>TM</sup> <p>machine.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made my first Flash 5 driven form tonight that actually submits data to a ColdFusion script (where it could then be stored in a database). I remember this feeling from when I was first discovering ColdFusion. What seems like a complete mystery begins to gel, and with time becomes more clear. Right now things are a bit muddy. I know the ColdFusion side of the process, but the Flash side is muddy. It will all make sense soon. Flash 5 is a component of a top secret project I&#8217;ve been conceptualizing for the past 6 months. I can&#8217;t wait until I can pull it off, it will be an awesome accomplishment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as I&#8217;m writing this, the news is reporting that 12 people have come in contact with anthrax, and 1 of those 12 has died from anthrax. This anthrax thing was mildly scary for me up until about 10 minutes ago, when I started thinking about how dangerous driving a car is. I&#8217;d be willing to bet that in the time it takes me to write this, a certain number of people will outright die from an auto accident. So why does anthrax get all the fuss? Why aren&#8217;t health officials banning the use of vehicles? The anthrax scare is stupid, I&#8217;m tired of hearing about it. I&#8217;m tired of hearing about airport terminals getting shut down because of spilled salt, or people getting scrubbed down against their will for no reason. This is simply absurd. I don&#8217;t understand how Americans can look at the amount of car related deaths and write it off as acceptable, yet when a single person out of 260 million dies of anthrax the nation is thrown into a complete and utter hissy fit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because anthrax is a scary sounding word. That&#8217;s all. People hear the word and freak. They think it will make their arms explode, or turn their children inside out. And it&#8217;s the name of a heavy metal band that made a bad crossover rap song.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&#8217;s up with New Jersey? Prior to 2001 New Jersey meant about as much to me as the love interests of the hottest boy bands. Now, in 2001, I&#8217;ve lived there, a good number of the terrorists who attacked the <span class="caps">WTC</span> lived about 5 minutes from where I was living (actually, about 3 minutes if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that I had to drive 2 miles to make a U turn to even go towards the city they lived in), and now, they&#8217;re saying most of the anthrax letters are coming from Trenton New Jersey. I wasn&#8217;t exactly pleased with New Jersey. The people I met and worked with were plenty nice, but as an environment, it just didn&#8217;t feel right, and now the taste of it will be stuck in my mind forever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a target="" href="http://www.ekosm.com/">Erik</a><p>&nbsp;made an important distinction between auto accidents and anthrax. Auto accidents are indeed accidents. Anthrax showing up in more and more locations can be considered an attempt at murder, already with a successful attempt.</p><br />
<p>My opinion on the anthrax scare is changing as more <strong>real </strong>threats occur. It&#8217;s still just as frustrating to hear about crippling shut downs at airports over confetti mistaken as anthrax. It worries me that any organization has exercised this much power over America, a nation whose freedoms are being threatened by fear and fear alone. I have such an anger building up towards anyone who thinks that they have the right to remove my freedoms, or my families freedoms that it may begin to get unhealthy, but I have an equally building anger building towards those who act like chickens with their heads cut off, freaking out over piles of salt. Whoever is waging the anthrax war against America must be very pleased. Their meager investment is paying off, and it&#8217;s sickening me.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I are going on an island hopping Carribean cruise, and it occurred to us that we&#8217;d have no place to put the camera while we spent our time in the ocean swimming or snorkeling. I started to research waterproof camera housings so we could keep the camera on us at all times and found the <a href="http://www.ewa-marine.com/English/e-start-photo.htm" target="_top">Ewa Marine</a> <p>site.</p><br />
<p>Ewa Marine makes bag housings that are far less expensive than a traditional solid housing (easily $700-800). The tradeoff: solid housings can go much deeper without your camera being crushed by the pressure. Bag housings can go down about 10 meters (or perhaps further, except they don&#8217;t protect the structure of your camera from the pressure).</p><br />
<p><img alt="Ewa Marine Housing" border="0" height="202" src="http://www.ewa-marine.com/Pictures/b-D-AM.jpg" width="300" /></p><br />
<p>So I called around to my local dive shops and they all sold the bag for $200 bucks. Way too much for me. I turned to the Internet to do some price camparison and found it being sold for about $75. Big difference! So I ordered one from <a href="http://www.photohabitat.com/CanonDigitalCameras.htm?mid=4467640&amp;catid=43422&amp;catname=Digital%20Still%20Camera%20Housings&amp;sku=D%2DAM&amp;cattree=Catalog%20%26amp%3B%20Prices%3E0%3EEwa%20Marine%20Prices%3E42646%3EDigital%20Still%20Camera%20Housings%3E43422" target="_top">www.photohabitat.com</a>&nbsp;and received it a few days later.</p><br />
<p>I tried the housing out last night and pool, and it worked great. Check out one of the shots (Carrie will probably kill me for putting this photo of her up, but it&#8217;s one of the more interesting ones that doesn&#8217;t show my white skinny butt underwater).</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a sad and scary month. Someday when I have children I may have to explain to them the general state of anxiety and fear Americans felt during the months following the September 11th attacks, and they may not fully understand it just like I never fully understood my parents fear of the Cold War and nuclear attacks. </p>
<p>I asked my grandmother if she would have ever guessed that America would be attacked like we were. She&#8217;s lived through Pearl Harbor, had a husband who fought in WW2, and has seen every war and conflict since and she said she couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening, and would have never guessed it would or could happen to us.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope my children will be able to feel comfortable with the world like I did prior to September 11. I hope that they won&#8217;t have to understand what it&#8217;s like to hear reports like &#8220;<span class="caps">FBI</span> warns of imminent attacks on US targets or overseas US interests.&#8221;</p>
