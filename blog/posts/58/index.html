  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because <a href="http://www.ekosm.com" target="_self">Erik</a> <p>is at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/" target="_self">Macromedia DevCon 2002</a>, and I&#8217;m not, I thought it might be a good time to make sure my ColdFusion/Macromedia MX skills are sharp and ready for intellectual battle for when he comes back. Actually, I don&#8217;t see so much of a battle occurring. I&#8217;m sure Erik is going to share a lot of cools things he&#8217;s learning, and I want to make sure my feeble mind is capable of understanding his new doctrine.</p><br />
<p>My approach to obtaining new skills or learning something new is usually the same. Total and complete immersion. I can&#8217;t do things in little bits, it goes against my nature. If I don&#8217;t consume it all with one giant bite, it goes in one ear and out the other. The new information has to clog up between my ears before I can make real sense of any of it.</p><br />
<p>In the past couple of days I&#8217;ve allowed this total immersion, or overload to occur, and it spawned at least&nbsp;two thoughts:</p><br />
<p>1. I&#8217;m not all that interested in talking about really technical things on my blog. I use my blog currently as a way to share stories and gives hints to my family as to what I&#8217;m up to. Talking about <span class="caps">CFMX</span> and J2EE, web services and all that nonsense doesn&#8217;t help in this venture.</p><br />
<p>2. Total immersion for me includes becoming an evangelist about the subject.&nbsp;The best way for me to learn is to teach, and by gum, that means I have to blab about what I&#8217;ve learned. Carrie is a very patient listener, but you can only expect non technical types to withstand so much.</p><br />
<p>The natural idea that occurs from those two thoughts is to start a ColdFusion or MX specific blog. But this of course requires a +1 to the list of projects I currently have set for myself. I&#8217;m posed with the internal dillema, to begin a new project or not. It&#8217;s a painful moment, and one not to be taken lightly now as my current activities outside of work are focused on helping raise a new child.</p><br />
<p>I think I need to take the cheap route. I need to use templates and ready built tools. I know, it tears my heart in two thinking of the prospect of not rolling my own, but I&#8217;m getting lazier. Get ready for <a href="http://www.mxdeveloper.com">www.mxdeveloper.com</a>, but don&#8217;t ready all that fast. It takes me about three years to finish or trash a project. Luckily, almost a year has passed on this idea, so we&#8217;re two thirds of the way there.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I joke about how unpopular I am and all, but let me tell you this: I just replied to one hundred twenty three emails, not including emails from family (I talk to them enough, no need to reply). I&#8217;m feeling like Mr. Popular right now. If I could flash a bright white toothy smile at you, I would, and I&#8217;d make the little finger-snap-point thing with accompying mouth noise.</p>
<p>If you know you emailed me between September and today, and you didn&#8217;t get a reply from me, then by all means I should crawl into a hole and die. But you could, once again, email me, and I swear I&#8217;ll reply. You see, I can&#8217;t be sure that the emails I replied to were the <em>only</em> <p>emails that went missing.</p><br />
<p>Oh, and I know with a high degree of certainty that if you emailed me before September that I will never see the email. I put way too much faith in my creations, and that&#8217;s what exposes the fool in me.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shame on me.&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Buffington is&nbsp;a terrible web site administrator. I&#8217;ve just discovered that for the past several months the <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/contact.cfm" target="_self">contact</a><p>&nbsp;page has been broken, and also, that I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of people using the page without me responding to the email it produces.</p><br />
<p>If I were my boss, I&#8217;d fire me for this offense. For those who have used the form and just assumed that I was pompous, elitist, idiotic, mildly-retarded, blind, snobbish, or, impossibly, just have so many emails I cannot respond, I apologize, and promise to reply to all of the messages that we&#8217;re luckily saved in a trash folder.</p><br />
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;ve tried nine ways to Sunday to break into my server to retrieve these messages, and just can&#8217;t crack it. I recognize this as an invitation to those who are adept at breaking into servers, but I&#8217;m counting on the good nature of the frightfully skilled to warn me of possible security shortcomings before making my life miserable. Besides, the most you&#8217;ll find on my server is lost emails that haven&#8217;t responded to, and at this point, there&#8217;s not much you can do to worsen that situation. Also, you might find this: <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/php/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=redrobot" target="_self">Mummy vs. Red Robot</a></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The movers arrived on Friday, delivering all 3880 pounds of material goods we&#8217;ve managed to accumulate over the years. The husband and wife movers deserve their own chapter, with their half coyote dog, their gypsy-like lifestyle, and the husband&#8217;s extreme obsession with mobile phones (he had three on his person), but I&#8217;ll save it for another time.</p>
<p>Friday night, I surveyed the results of their efforts. There were two places in the apartment that you could see the floor: directly in front of the master bedroom toilet, and in the area where the front door swings in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/carrie" target="_self">Carrie</a> <p>and <a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/leah" target="_self">Leah</a> came home on Saturday to this mess. The immediate task was to make room for Leah&#8217;s bed. I went nuts Friday night making a bed for myself, so by midday Saturday, we could all nap in relative comfort.</p><br />
<p>The rest of the weekend was spend shifting, unpacking, organizing, and slowly reducing the box count to the point where we could see the furniture underneath.</p><br />
<p>Today, we have a nursery, a relatively clear master bedroom, an almost clear living room, and a kitchen that is almost livable. The office/guestroom is packed full of office stuff, as is the guest bathroom. It&#8217;s still going to be a big effort to finish the last mile, as it always is.</p><br />
<p>And yes, all of the above is an elaborate excuse for not having new photos of Leah up. As soon as I can set a computer up at home, I&#8217;ll be posting some new photos of the now nine pounder with kung fu action.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why is one room in my apartment in Oregon suddenly, almost overnight, filled with lady bugs? Before going to sleep last night I counted twenty-seven. All alive, all crawling the walls.</p>
<p>The fact that they are lady bugs keeps them safe from my thrown shoe, that and I&#8217;m moving out today, to a deluxe apartment on the ground floor. I don&#8217;t want to dirty the walls with their guts.</p>
<p>At 3:30am I was dreaming that I was in the dinosaur ride at Knott&#8217;s Berry Farm. That ride used to have a very dark section you&#8217;d roll through, where strings or something would be hanging down and would brush across your face. It would send shivers down the spine of the most brave.</p>
<p>Waking from the dream, I realized that while the dream had gone, the sensation was still there. I felt my face. Animals on my face. Bugs. After freaking out and flailing a bit, I turned on the light, expecting to see lady bugs. No. Different kind of bug, a bug I&#8217;ve never seen. I expect there were at least three on my face. I kill them all, not as punishment, but as prevention. I don&#8217;t want to have this happen again in my sleep. They don&#8217;t die easy. I employ a combination of pressure and heat, squeezing them between thumb and forefinger sandwhiched between a plastic bag, then pinning them against the lens of my halogen reading light which has become quite toasty.</p>
<p>I sleep uneasy until six, when it&#8217;s time to wake. I think I&#8217;ve got the flu or something, or maybe some disease these bugs transmitted through my snoring mouth in my sleep, because this morning I&#8217;m a wreck. All body functions have adopted anarchy, and are acting in complete dischord.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find any sites on the net that can help me identify this bug. I&#8217;ll have to post a picture here to enlist the help of the three of you who read this site.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m not too happy about people singling SpongeBob Squarepants out as a &#8220;&#8221;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/po/20021008/co_po/_spongebob__cartoon_attracts_gay_fans&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gay icon<p>&#8220;. I think that&#8217;s about as stupid as calling Bugs Bunny a transvestite icon because he sometimes dresses like a woman to trick Daffy Duck. It&#8217;s as lame as suggesting Fred Flintsone is a heterosexual icon, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I&#8217;d even stop to think &#8220;hey, that Fred, he&#8217;s certainly manly, and representive of all heterosexuals, I nominate him as Heterosexual Cartoon Icon of the Year&#8221;.</p><br />
<p>SpongeBob Squarepants is a pretty innocent cartoon, never even getting close to anything sexually related. The <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/po/20021008/co_po/_spongebob__cartoon_attracts_gay_fans" target="_self">article</a> linked above cites that because he&#8217;s male (which, is a hasty assumption considering sponges are asexual, a fact not passed over by the show&#8217;s creator, a marine biologist) and because he&#8217;s soft, and sometimes holds his best friend&#8217;s hand that he&#8217;s likely gay. If I were gay, I&#8217;d be offended by the association. It insults my intelligence first of all, and second of all, why the hell would I need a gay icon of a sponge cartoon? I&#8217;d want a gay icon with a little more significance. </p><br />
<p>Stupid. Let kids be innocent of anything sexual for once. Quit trying to cram sexuality and sexual preference down our kids throats. Quit making sex so important to children.</p><br />
<p>Now how&#8217;s that for a topic shift?</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up with a line of classical music in my head this morning, and now I can&#8217;t remember it. It was high fidelity in my brain when I woke up, and now its lost forever. I still feel like a dough head. Maybe I need to drink more water.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back in Oregon now, getting ready to move from our third floor apartment to a first floor apartment with an extra bedroom.</p>
<p>When I left Oregon three weeks ago, I left quickly. When I got back, my apartment was a symphony of cheap beeping. Two fire alarm batteries were low, the alarms sending out warning chirps at seemingly random intervals. The chirps so terse that pinpointing which alarm was sounding was difficult at best. My fax machine had recieved five spam faxes, but ran out of paper for the seven more that came. Panasonic, in an effort to sell more toner, saves unprinted faxes in memory, with no way of purging them, and sends out a shrill tone every twenty seconds reminding anyone within earshot to supply it with paper. I&#8217;m sure my house was beeping like this for at least two weeks. The fax machine is unplugged.</p>
