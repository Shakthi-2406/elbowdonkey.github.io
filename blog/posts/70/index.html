  <div class="entry-content"><p>I almost got in a fight with two teenage lesbian smokers last night. This doesn&#8217;t happen on a regular basis so I should explain how and what happened. Last night I went to the Weezer/No Doubt/Offspring concert at the Long Beach arena, and between No Doubt and Offspring, two girls two rows in front of me began smoking. Now, normally I&#8217;m not a crazy freak about telling people to stop smoking around me, but damnit I paid good money for my seats and I wasn&#8217;t about to let them be inconsiderate to everyone around them. People sitting next to them and directly behind them we&#8217;re asking them to stop, and when the smoke started getting in my space I sort of snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put out your cigarette!&#8221; I yelled. I cupped my hands around my mouth making a sort of megaphone, and yelled it in my most firm voice. I had to yell it three times. The third time they turned around, at which point I said, again, loudly, &#8220;Nobody around you wants to smoke. Take your cigarette outside or put it out.&#8221; They were ready to throw down. I didn&#8217;t know they were lesbians at this point (and really the lesbian thing is irrelevant, it just made for a good opening sentence). Their response to my yelling was &#8220;Well, that girl over there is smoking!&#8221;, which was the stupidest reason I&#8217;ve ever heard to smoke. I responded &quot;Then she sucks too. Take your cigarette outside or put it out <strong>now!</strong><p>&#8220;</p><br />
<p>That seemed to do the job. I was ready to climb over the row in front of me to invade their space like they were invading mine and put it out. I&#8217;ve never had to be so persisent in asking someone to stop smoking. Prior to last night, most smokers have been very polite and compliant when asked to stop smoking. They know their habit annoys others, and most people aren&#8217;t in the habit of pissing people off.</p><br />
<p>I may mouth off about smoking again soon, but it&#8217;s time to work.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&#8217;s up with Alf? Remember the show, A.L.F? Suddenly Alf is back, and I&#8217;m perplexed. What makes this more frightening is how Alf suddenly re-invaded my life.</p>
<p>While driving to work the other day I was listening to <a href="http://www.kroq.com/kevinandbean/kb.html" target="">Kevin &amp; Bean</a><p>. They were talking about a new 10-10-220 commercial that starred none other than Alf. The Alien Life Form that likes to eat cats. The &#8220;No problem&#8221; Alf with a faked Brooklyn accent.</p><br />
<p>The second someone made the first mention of Alf on the radio, Alf cut me off. That&#8217;s right. A yuck colored Honda Civic cut me off with a license plate that simply said &#8220;<span class="caps">ALF</span>&#8221;. I have proof, it&#8217;s fuzzy due to my eagerness to capture the moment, and a high rate of speed.</p><br />
<p><img height="247" alt="Alf cut me off." src="/mb/images/alf.jpg" width="300" border="0" /></p><br />
<p>Any thing Alf related at this point is not merely a coincidence, it&#8217;s an Alf invasion.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com/" target="">Google.com</a> <p>is a bit tweaked. I know this because if you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cinnamon" target="">search for cinnamon</a>, <a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com">www.stinkfactor.com</a> comes up in fourth or fifth place. Google indexed <a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com/challenges/cinnamon.cfm" target="">The Cinnamon Challenge</a> of course which, as of late, has been very popular, but I&#8217;m sure those who search for cinnamon are actually looking for cinnamon, not someone blasting it out his nose and then bleeding into a trashcan.</p><br />
<p>But for the same reason Google is listing stinkfactor.com in the results it&#8217;s also placing my resume at the top of list for &#8220;&#8221;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=coldfusion+resume&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;coldfusion resume&quot; which is pretty cool. Although, when happily employed this can be an annoyance.</p></p>
