  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I posted some <a href="home.cfm?id=305" target="">links</a> <p>to some very old blog entries, and amongst those old entries was <a href="home.cfm?id=296" target="">one</a> about finding <a href="http://www.joemaller.com" target="_self">Joe Maller</a>&#8216;s site.</p><br />
<p>When I first found his site back in August of 1998 I was going through a sort of design/creativity binge. I was seriously considering enrolling at <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/" target="">Art Center</a> in Pasadena, and realized that he had gone there. He immediately became a target for me, and luckily he put up with my intensity of questions&nbsp;at the time.</p><br />
<p>Joe, reading my most recent entry about himself, dug up all of the emails we had sent back and forth at the time, and has <a href="http://www.joemaller.com/mb_letters.shtml" target="">posted</a> them on his site.</p><br />
<p>What I find interesting while reading them is how intense I am in getting some &#8220;answers&#8221; about Art Center and&nbsp;web design in general. So intense that, without a first response, I email him again. I&#8217;d be annoyed with me. I&#8217;m grateful that he was patient, because I did end up going to Art Center, and loving it, even if I wasn&#8217;t fully enrolled.</p><br />
<p>It&#8217;s wierd to think back to that time when I was so fixated on breaking into web design and ColdFusion programming. I still have some of that same fixation, but I haven&#8217;t stopped, until now, and looked back at where I&#8217;ve been. It&#8217;s been a truly incredible path, having started a very successful&nbsp;dot com in the middle of planning my wedding to Carrie, written a book on the very thing I found so very difficult at first, developed lasting friendships with people, with countless mini and major successes tossed in. In retrospect, the unending failures and disasters are fading, while the intensity to succeed is now being metered with experience.</p><br />
<p>Thanks to Joe for taking the time to chat with me back in &#8217;98. It made a lasting impression.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might be an egg head and already realize this, but it occurs to me that introspection gets easier with age and experiences.</p>
<p>This gem of truth was brought on by my thinking about how I hated the <a href="http://www.flyingj.com/" target="">Flying J</a> <p>brand when I was no more than twelve years old. With the power of Introspection, it all makes sense now, and it didn&#8217;t then.</p><br />
<p>When I was a kid my family couldn&#8217;t afford fancy Club Med vacations or little jaunts to the Swiss Alps for days of effortless skiing through feather-like fluffy powder while eating fondue. We took road trips to exotic destinations like Redding California, or Pocatello Idaho while eating beef jerky and&nbsp;smelling like fondue three hours out.</p><br />
<p>Hours in a car on a roadtrip to a twelve year old are longer than they are to those in their late thirties to early forties. It&#8217;s a percentages game. Ten hours to a twelve year old is, if we carry the two, three times as long as an hour to an adult. By the same math, the younger you are, the longer your hours feel in relation to your entire life. An hour long roadtrip for an hour old baby would literally be a lifetime to the baby.</p><br />
<p>On roadtrips, the Flying J sign is everywhere. In&nbsp;certain parts of Utah, it&#8217;s not a dishonest claim to say you can see&nbsp;a dozen in a hour span.&nbsp;It&#8217;s like a mirage that haunts you as you watch blurred fields whizzing by as you imagine that you were riding a mini-bike over the hills at 75mph rather than playing volleyball with your brother&#8217;s sweaty, sleep induced, nodding head. </p><br />
<p>With the power of introspection, it makes sense why&nbsp;the logo itches at you with it&#8217;s weak font, with it&#8217;s yellow, orange, and red stripes. It&#8217;s lack of creativity is insulting. As a twelve year old, it simply &#8220;sucked&#8221;. The reasons why couldn&#8217;t be articulated by a mind concerned with plots of sneaking pocket lint into sleeping siblings mouths, but with a little bit of time&nbsp;it now all makes sense.</p><br />
<p>A drunken trucker who loved nothing more in this world than his ZZ Top bandana and his fake spurs could have drooled a better logo than a flying J, and I knew this at age twelve. I knew that if someone was gonna get my buck, they&#8217;d better have a damn good logo.</p><br />
<p>Speaking of logos, <a href="http://www.torrez.org/" target="">Andre Torrez</a> <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/000288.php#000288" target="">needs one</a>, and he&#8217;s managed to get a lot of submissions. Imagine if Flying J had 48 drunken truckers submitting drool logos? I might have enjoyed roadtrips more.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re vegetarian, please don&#8217;t try to replicate meat. Please, no more&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freshtofu.com/tofu_turkey.html" target="">tofu turkeys</a><p>, <a href="http://www.gnc.com/health_notes/Food_Guide/Textured_Veg_Protein.htm" target="">textured vegetable protein</a>, or <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/diet.fitness/08/12/quorn.protests.ap/index.html" target="">meat made from fungus</a>. It&#8217;s all too wierd, like something out of a bad dream. Meat is meat, vegetables are vegetables. Making meat like substitutes is disgusting. Imagine making a carrot out of ground beef, or how about a tossed green bacon salad. Eat your vegetables as vegetables. Don&#8217;t pretend your jiggling-like-jello tofu turkey is anything other than tofu.</p><br />
<p><sup>1</sup>I&#8217;ve actually witnessed and tasted&nbsp;a real tofu turkey before. Despite my plea for &#8220;no more meat substitutes&#8221;, I&#8217;m no stranger to the vegetarian diet. And that picture of the tofu turkey looks simply horrid, like something that came out of a sick buffalo.</p><br />
<p><sup>2</sup>I&#8217;ve been teasing Carrie lately, saying it would be cool to have pasta made infused with meat. Like spinach pasta, or these other fancy colorful pastas. Beef pasta would be fantastic.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My webserver is incredibly loud. It&#8217;s because there are probably four fans in the <a href="http://www.antec-inc.com/en_plus1060.html" target="">case</a><p>, all humming away trying to keep the fancy leading edge processor <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_756,00.html" target="">chip</a> cool. This same chip literally popped and sent out a wisp of smoke the first time I turned on the computer because it didn&#8217;t have the <span class="caps">CPU</span> fan fitted properly.</p><br />
<p>With the webserver now in the closet of my bedroom office, the noise is still intense. Imagine sitting near the engines on a jet airplane, 24 hours a day (well, it just arrived via <a href="http://www.fedex.com/cgi-bin/tracking?tracknumbers=7918+9962+0606&amp;action=track&amp;language=english&amp;cntry_code=us&amp;mps=y" target="">FedEx</a>, so it&#8217;s been maybe 18 hours).</p><br />
<p>I set out to find how best to quiet this server, and found plenty of <a href="http://fredrik.hubbe.net/silence/other.html" target="">ideas</a>. I&#8217;m looking for cheap and easy, so high end acoustical insulation and submerging my server in non-conductive mineral oil like a <span class="caps">NASA</span> showoff&nbsp;are off the list. Asthetics are an issue, which is why <a href="http://www.overclockers.com/tips873/" target="">encasing</a> my server in a giant wooden box is no good, and having the computer coverless with everything exposed is not desirable. Cost is an issue, and quiet components can be <a href="http://www.endpcnoise.com/cgi-bin/e/silentcomputer.html" target="">expensive</a>.</p><br />
<p>I think the best solution, culled from the articles, is to <a href="http://www.cublea.com/rants/shutup/index.html" target="">reduce the amount of fans</a> (keeping an eye on <span class="caps">CPU</span> health by using <a href="http://www.hmonitor.com/" target="">software</a> that reports the temperature) and perhaps using some <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/projects/case_noise/index.shtml" target="">carpet padding</a> to insulate sound from the inside.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did a little digging and found some blog entries that were over <a href="home.cfm?id=287" target="">four years old</a><p>. This screwed me up in a few ways. First, according to the rules and regulations that govern my current blog, tomorrow would have been it&#8217;s three year anniversary. The oldest entry I could find was dated June 4th 1998, so I missed my four year anniversay by a few months. Second, dang man, I sucked at writing, and I was a cocky, stubborn child.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m amazed out how young and stupid I sound in my entries. But, there are some interesting historical points for those who care. I talk about wanting to <a href="home.cfm?id=289" target="">learn more about UI</a>, <a href="home.cfm?id=303" target="">wanting to write better</a>, and I drop a <a href="home.cfm?id=300" target="">big hint</a> about <a href="http://www.price.com" target="">Price.com</a>, which was a pretty big milestone in my life, and other peoples&#8217; lives as well. I had a dream that Price.com would be something big, but I never had an idea of how big, or all of the consequences, good and bad, that it would produce. It&#8217;s a shadow of what it was in it&#8217;s prime, but it&#8217;s still around due to some of the same dedicated people who were there towards the start.</p><br />
<p>I <a href="home.cfm?id=296" target="">discovered</a> <a href="http://www.joemaller.com" target="">Joe Maller</a>, who&#8217;s blog I&#8217;ve probably been to every day since. Back in those days, it seemed that Joe and his wife lived a sort of parallel life to myself and my wife when it came to our travels. We&#8217;d been to the same places in the same order at nearly the same times. I&#8217;ve vowed to take him to lunch the next time our paths cross, I owe him one for the fun thoughts he&#8217;s provoked over the years.</p><br />
<p>I was also pretty outspoken, and <a href="home.cfm?id=304" target="">loved using frames</a> on websites. Hard to believe I wrote any of that when I read it, and man how time flies.</p><br />
<p>The scary thing is that I know, somewhere, more old blog entries of mine lie in wait to be discovered. There were at least two or three older versions of my personal site, starting as far back as 1995.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday evening I was driving from the skatepark in Newberg to the city pool to pick up Carrie after she was finished doing her laps. On the way, I heard something I hadn&#8217;t heard since I was a little kid.</p>
<p>Every third or fourth Friday of the month, our city used to test it&#8217;s air raid sirens. They produced a deep long wailing sound, which, if you weren&#8217;t used to, could be quite forboding. They stopped doing it for whatever reason, and I hadn&#8217;t heard it for years.</p>
<p>Last night, I heard it again, but this time my reaction was a bit different. One of the first things I did was switch on the news to make sure the sky wasn&#8217;t falling. For a moment, I was genuinely worried by the noise, thinking the sirens were being used for their intended purposes (eminent attack)&nbsp;for perhaps the first time. Pretty weird.</p>
