  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was looking at some site logs specifically trying to determine how many people came to a particular site through a Google search when a problem jumped to mind.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the ratio is of users who searched for a term, and those who searched for a term and made it to the site in question. The answer to that question has some value I think. Knowing the ratio could help you tweak your site so that the description that showed up in Google produced more click throughs (though this would likely change where your page showed up in the results, making this a moving target).</p>
<p>In any case, I was about write off the problem, thinking I could never know what Google&#8217;s stats were when a splendidly simple solution struck me:</p>
<p>Buy a text ad on Google for the keyword you&#8217;re tracking. Pay just enough so that the ad shows up always (if possible). Basically, pay Google to show you their stats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to think about it for a while, then do some tests. Can you see any flaws?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that since Napster the music industry has been in a big huff over &#8220;stolen&#8221; music and the movie industry has been in a similar huff lately over Bittorrent. Everyone on both sides is in this huge sort of sweaty arm-wrestling match stalemate, both sides threatening to break their arms under the expended energy.</p>
<p>I have the solution. And it&#8217;s so simple.</p>
<p>Those who have the most stake in making sure people pay for their music and videos should stop waging silly lawsuits against 9 year olds and focus their energies on something entirely different: hardware.</p>
<p>Remember when U2 did this thing with the iPod where they put their whole collection and a new album on it for a few bucks? What if that&#8217;s the way it was with everything, except slightly different. What if the thing you bought when you went to Virgin Records wasn&#8217;t just the media, it was the media and the player. If it was a movie maybe it would have a little projector built in and have some kinda of wireless broadcast that made it possible to pump it out to authorized devices based on some standard. Same with music, except maybe the music devices would be the size of a Tic Tac or something with wireless output to fancy wireless headphones.</p>
<p>And make it so the media within the device was impossible to go corrupt, so there&#8217;d be no loopholes with &#8220;backup rights&#8221;. Build super redundancy into the device or make it solid state or whatever, but make it so the data is everlasting. Maybe make it so it&#8217;s able to check itself and if some part is corrupt, it automatically talks to some node on the Internet that pulls down the complete copy of data. You&#8217;d expect to pay a bit more for the Everlasting versions maybe. Work hard at making the tech cheap, invent new things, make money by licensing your tech, and bring it to the masses on the cheap.</p>
<p>And make it so all those media devices connected like Legos (in fact, make them Legos) so that once connected, you had a jukebox of media, and you could shuffle between everything. Make it so that carrying around 40GB of music or movies took up no more space than an iPod does today.</p>
<p>Then, when people figured out how to rip you off, ignore them and make your hardware cooler than it is. Stay ahead of the game by innovating instead of retaliating, and spend money on advancing tech that makes your product worth buying rather than stealing it. Makes it possible for me to build a Lego castle with working drawbridge that also contains all my media.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While looking for information on how to migrate from Microsoft Entourage to Mozilla Thunderbird, I came across this official entry from Microsoft. Somewhere deep within the bowels of the Microsoft Support System, some Mac hater is giggling with mirth over his <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/871016">cruel little joke</a>.</p>
<p>[I took the image down. It was ugly. The joke was that in Safari, the entire support document spanned several screens and was completely microscopic without so much as a single bit of whitespace. Impossible to read, and therefore, get any use or support out of it at all.]</p>
<p>Luckily OS X has a zoom feature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jonas started crawling the other day. He literally went from only being able to lay flat on his stomach, cursing his immobility, to crawling at about 10mph, which at scale is more like 2000mph. He&#8217;ll tear across a room towards a toy on the ground only to completely redirect himself and his momentum toward another toy that catches his eye midway through is mad trek.</p>
<p>Also, totally coincidentally, our floors are cleaner and Jonas has cut back on the quantity of food he eats during meal time. Mysteries, these little humans.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m trying this new iBook + G5 setup I&#8217;m thinking about applications are absolutely essential to my day to day computer work. I figured I&#8217;d share the list as I decide what gets to stay on my tiny drive:</p>
<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a><br />
Absolutely essentially. Such a powerful little tool, I&#8217;d be stupid not to include it. I can switch/launch applications, control iTunes, fire off AppleScripts &#8211; super handy, and free for now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium X</a><br />
I could get by without it and use iChat, but Adium does a much better job at chat than iChat, and it&#8217;s free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a><br />
All my email and newsgroup browsing will be consolidated to Thunderbird 1.0 (which still has a few bugs, but far far less than the last version). Also free.</p>
<p><a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a><br />
A small and stable text editor with OK color syntax highlighting. I like it because I can open up multiple documents into a single window. I hate window clutter. Free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop CS</a><br />
Can&#8217;t live without it. I wish it were a bit smaller, and I wish you didn&#8217;t have to reinstall it to move it from one drive to the other. Not free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a><br />
Java <span class="caps">IDE</span> that is also my ColdFusion <span class="caps">IDE</span>. Very versitile with tons of plugins available. Free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/affrus/">Affrus</a><br />
Excellent Perl editor. Perl is still very new to me, and Affrus helps ease the pain with good syntax highlighting, code hints, and a debugger. I paid $99 for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html">Carbon Copy Cloner</a><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do neat disk things without it. Free.</p>
<p><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat</a><br />
Great J2EE server. Easy to install, easy to develop for, and free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/">ColdFusion MX</a><br />
Easy to install as J2EE servlet running under Tomcat. Full featured developers&#8217; version is free.</p>
<p>Also telling is what I left off the list. I&#8217;m not using Firefox at all lately &#8211; Safari does a great job for me. The only thing I could think of using Firefox for is if I wanted to use a lot of extensions, which I don&#8217;t typically use. I suppose it&#8217;s good to have to do browser checks with, but I don&#8217;t consider it essential for the Mac (though it is absolutely essential for the PC).</p>
<p>Expect to see the list updated as I make the transition to a new drive. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve missed some things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had this sort of puzzle brewing in my head recently about how to keep my iBook synced with my desktop G5 and the answer struck me today with such clarity: screw keeping them synced &#8211; work directly off the iBook all the time, sort of.</p>
<p>With Macs you can setup a computer to act as a &#8220;Firewire Target&#8221; by holding down T as it boots up. You can then connect that computer to another computer with a Firewire cable, and the other computers sees the drive of the first computer as a portable Firewire drive. Pretty clever.</p>
<p>With Macs you can also boot off external hard drives by pressing the Alt button as the computer boots. Put those two ideas together and you get the solution to my puzzle: setup the iBook as a Firewire Target, then boot the G5 off the iBook HD. If I need to travel I can shut everything down and take my iBook with me and I have all of my applications and all of my data (provided I saved it to the iBook drive) intact.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some limitations &#8211; my iBook has a 30GB HD, and nearly half of that is taken up by the OS itself. So I have about 15GB of space to put my essential applications on as well as any projects I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p>But when I think about space limitations I welcome the idea &#8211; I will be forced into keeping my machine tidy (something I&#8217;m not concerned with on a 160GB HD) and in order to stay tidy, I need to stay organized. Staying organized has benefits beyond keeping my hard drive lean. I can use my nearly 400GB of space on other drives throughout my house as &#8220;deep storage&#8221; and even carry one along when I travel if the data won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m going to try the setup out for a while and see how it goes. I&#8217;ll report back in a month after the glow of the new idea has faded.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, so new year resolutions are pretty stupid, I admit, but they give me something to write about and ponder for at least a few weeks, so here goes. Resolutions <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2004/01/adios_2003.html">from last year</a> that I actually made some progress on:</p>
<p><i>1. Cut my hair before it puts strain on my neck</i><br />
I totally dominated this one. I even gave myself a haircut, and being totally horrified by the results, buzzed the remaining hair off with a machine. An actual machine!</p>
<p><i>2. Give the milk a sniff before consumption</i><br />
Conquered! But not by my own doing. Having a toddler in the house means that milk is always fresh, as it&#8217;s consumed so fast it never could go rancid unless we were victims of some huge dairy bottling incident. Not a single rancid milk event for the year of 2004. That was awesome.</p>
<p><i>3. Finish what I start</i><br />
Definitely better this year. Projects like wordphoto.org (which is totally broken right now) were thought of a finished rapidly. Towards the last half of the year though things got busy and projects got bigger. I tried building a file server from spare parts yesterday, and would have finished it except that the <span class="caps">CPU</span> burnt up &#8211; the fan wasn&#8217;t working. I&#8217;ll have to scrounge some other spare parts to finish it.</p>
<p><i>4. Resume my editorial illustration career</i><br />
I did a lot more illustration this year, though digitally. I don&#8217;t have time like I used to to get all my paints setup, gather my brushes, prep surfaces and stuff. Whipping up something in Adobe Illustrator is so much quicker and easier. I do miss the real thing though.</p>
<p><i>5. Make serious progress on the big fancy secret project</i><br />
I never remember what this was. Maybe I made progress, maybe not.</p>
<p><i>6. Fall down less</i><br />
I fell down less. Strange thing &#8211; I stopped wearing safety gear entirely except for the helmet. At first it was just because the pads smelled so bad I couldn&#8217;t bear to get near them, but then I started noticing that I actually fell down less. I was being more careful and spending more energy thinking about how not to fall, and my skateboarding improved. Funny how that works.</p>
<p><i>7. Become 100% debt free.</i><br />
No comment.</p>
<p>I basically made no progress on all other resolutions from last year, so no point in rehashing them. Most will die. I&#8217;m not making any for this year. I have too much to do as it is, and can&#8217;t be burdened with new resolutions.</p>
