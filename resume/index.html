      <h2>Traits</h2>

      <p>I relentlessly solve problems. Some developers are architects, scientists, theorists, etc. <strong>I'm a honey badger.</strong> I find a way.</p>

      <p>I love to amplify the abilities of the teams I lead. I know how to pair different personalities, abilities, and experiences to produce enthusiastic and productive teams. People who, when working together, accomplish far greater things then when apart.</p>

      <p>As an engineer I learn new languages, reverse protocols, devour documentation, build up, tear down, improve, and iterate <em>ad infinitum</em>. I happily pursue solutions to problems even as those problems change. I actually <strong>enjoy</strong> solving bugs. <em>"Impossible"</em> is my biggest competitor, and I'm <strong>always</strong> dismantling it.</p>

      <p>I'm happiest when I'm solving problems that <em>seem</em> unsolvable but are nevertheless important to solve. I'm the most productive when I know what constraints I need to accept, where I have room to run free, and when the end goal is clearly defined.</p>

      <p>Above all else <strong>I care deeply</strong> about the experience someone has when they use what I help create. <strong>I enjoy the journey</strong> of creating something, but <strong>I live for seeing someone benefit from what I create.</strong></p>

      <h2>Leadership</h2>

      <p>I've hired and managed nearly a hundred developers, designers, managers, and sales people in my career. I know what makes teams productive and what makes teams apathetic. I know when a junior level engineer has serious potential, and when a talented rockstar would be a bad hire. I've always had a talent for connecting people who I know will work well together and I have honed that skill over the past 20 years.</p>

      <h2>Tech Skills Summary</h2>

      <p>I have decades of experience building web applications using various technologies. I'm fluent in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, CoffeeScript, ES6, React, Webpack, PHP, and ColdFusion. I'm capable with Python, Perl, Java, Objective C, C, C++, C# and .Net. I know database design, having worked extensively with Oracle platforms, MS SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, and a handful of nosql products.</p>

      <p>I have extensive experience working within variations of "agile" models - from XP to Scrum. I know enough to know which parts of those methodologies work. I know when to practice those principles and I know what values those practices support.</p>

      <p>In my spare time I try to get smarter every day. I build machines, robots, and flying things, I take photographs, play guitar, skateboard, and I try to convince my kids to love learning as much as I do.</p>

    <p>I upgraded a massive ColdFusion application from a very old version of ColdFusion to the newly introduced Java based ColdFusion. This required writing a tool to pinpoint what source code needed to be updated and allowed for safely converting thousands of lines of code that supported tools used by thousands of enterprise customers.</p>

    <p>Xerox sent me to work in their UK office to help build a consumables replenishment application. The application supported hundreds of different currency, language, and locale based combinations. On launch day the application processed over $1,000,000 in transactions. Prior to launching this tool, all consumable reordering was done through phone calls to local service reps.</p>
