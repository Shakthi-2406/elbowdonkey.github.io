  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally tried <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007360">Matt&#8217;s setup</a>, where he has a single keyboard and mouse that can travel from his Powerbook&#8217;s display to his PC. I remember when he explained it to me (or I should say tried to) it seemed to be incredibly complicated. I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around what he was actually doing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I downloaded <a href="http://fredrik.hubbe.net/win2vnc.html">Win2VNC</a> and instantly it all made sense (and worked). I have three computers on my desk, each with their own display. From left to right, I have a generic PC with it&#8217;s own monitor, a Toshiba laptop with it&#8217;s own display, and a 17&quot; iMac, with it&#8217;s own built in display. There&#8217;s no way a <span class="caps">KVM</span> switch would work to make it possible for me to use one keyboard and mouse to command each machine. Win2VNC, however, makes it possible.</p>
<p>On my generic PC I set up a <span class="caps">VNC</span> server, and on my iMac I do the same. My Toshiba laptop, which sits in the middle, runs two instances of Win2VNC. Win2VNC is essentially a <span class="caps">VNC</span> client, except that it sits right on the edge of the screen you&#8217;re running it on. It&#8217;s almost like you have a connection to a <span class="caps">VNC</span> server through the standard <span class="caps">VNC</span> client, and you&#8217;ve pushed it all the way to the edge of the screen, so that all but a one pixel column is on the edge of your screen. Normally, once you pushed your mouse over to that side of the screen, it would run out of room to travel, but Win2VNC allows it to travel off the screen, which makes it show up on the host machine you&#8217;re connected to.</p>
<p>It all sounds very complicated, but really, it&#8217;s slam dunk easy. If you have two computers nearby with a display each, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try. It&#8217;s truly fantastic to see my mouse cursor move across three different screens of three different computers, all of which are completely autonomous.</p>
<p>It has some obvious advantages and disadvantages though. You&#8217;re not able to drag a window from one app to the other (although, it seems like it could be done*). You are, however, able to take advantage of multiple CPUs. When one machine is hunkered down, the other is ready and waiting to do whatever you want it to. That aspect is quite refreshing.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It seems like you could have an uber-<span class="caps">VNC</span> client, that acted as both client and host, and would allow you to display the window/app/whatever on the connected machines. Sort of like a networked video card or something. Because all <span class="caps">VNC</span> does when it displays another machine&#8217;s desktop is draw a bitmap of that desktop, it could put some smarts into it and simply draw individual windows. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, I think there are some X Windows apps that can pull this off.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, I can assume that you&#8217;re sitting down. It&#8217;s the nature of the medium, but if you&#8217;re not, you either have very good posture or are all hunched over, in which case, you should be sitting down. The news I share is heavy, and not for light reading. (Which isn&#8217;t true, but play along.)</p>
<p>I changed my mouse catching tact last night. I scrubbed the traps, putting some serious elbow into wiping out every scent of anything possible from the traps. I wanted them to smell new, as if I had just purchased them. And then, remembering that once I had found a Reese&#8217;s Mini Peanut Butter Cup from Halloween half eaten by a mouse, right through the wrapper, I sliced a cup in half, being ever so careful not to touch it. I used the knife to drop a half in each trap.</p>
<p>I placed the traps right in the middle of the counter top, knowing the bastard had been cruising about there lately. He&#8217;s found a passage from the innards of the stove where he lives to the top of the counter through a vent on top of the stove. He treats that counter top as if it were his front yard, and thus, the traps found a new home there.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas the night before the night before the eve of Christmas, not a creature was stirring. Except for the mouse. At about 11:17PM, I heard the door swing shut on one of the traps. &#8220;Mr. Bastardio is mine!&#8221; I whispered under my breath, not wanting to wake Carrie. I decided I&#8217;d let him fester overnight. But then, I heard the door of the second trap fall. &#8220;Two mice? What?!&#8221;. I accepted that possibility, and told myself to be glad, having caught twice as many mouse as I intended.</p>
<p>This morning: I carefully peeked into one of the traps, remembering very well that if I opened it right up, the dude would just bolt out and shame my family. The first trap contained no mouse, just half a peanut butter cup. The second trap contained no mouse. But more shocking &#8211; the second trap contained no peanut butter cup. The bastard has officially outsmarted my traps, and he&#8217;s forced me to get mean.</p>
<p>The glue traps are coming, and the first one is going right outside his front door. And when I catch him, I&#8217;m going to lecture him about his manners, then feed him to the neighbors dog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> and I went shooting at <a href="http://www.departmentofskateboarding.com">Department of Skateboarding</a> again last night. The session was a bit tense last night, as there were a few guys dominating the bowl that seemed to be new there. I think this dominance was annoying the regulars, so the vibe was a lot different than normal. What&#8217;s usually a fun filled evening seemed a bit more like elbowing and jockeying for position on some kind of invisible pyramid.</p>
<p>When Matt comes, I sort of feel guilty for dropping him into this kind of intense pit of action. I&#8217;ve been in his position before, where I&#8217;m trying to fathom all of the different technical aspects of my equipment on top of wrestling with unknown and advanced photographic techniques &#8211; not to mention the human factor. It&#8217;s hard to tell if the people riding are happy or upset about you shooting them, and the opportunity to chit chat with them doesn&#8217;t come up often. I remember when I first started shooting how timid and intimidated I was, and I, perhaps irrationally, harbour guilt for introducing the &#8220;sport&#8221; to Matt.</p>
<p>But then I remember the payoff. All of the awkwardness with your equipment and the atmosphere pays off when you get a shot that approximates what you were aiming for. You forget all about whatever concerns or frustrations you had, and you get recharged for the next shot. And with Digital SLRs, you get the payoff immediately.</p>
<p>Last night I thought that skateboarding photography is sort of like going deep sea fishing. You&#8217;re likely to catch all sorts of things, most of those things being completely undesirable or simply average, but sometimes, you catch a marlin or huge chomping mako shark, and you realize why you stepped out of your comfort zone in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to keep learning, because there is an obvious style and art to skateboarding photography that will continue to challenge me as long as I live. I&#8217;ve grown up with it all my life, and shots I see by the best photographers speak to me in so many ways, and continue to do so as I begin to learn their art.</p>
<p>And to prove me 90% undesireable / 10% mako analogy, I&#8217;m starting an album of all of the <a href="http://mx.blogs.com/photos/skate_raw/">original shots</a> with no color corrections, contrast adjustment, cropping, or anything. It&#8217;ll help me recognize my progress, as well as give hope to those just starting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried upgrading from ColdFusion MX 6.0 to ColdFusion MX 6.1 on my Linux based web server, and all hell broke loose. So rather than choose to upgrade, I gutted <span class="caps">CFMX</span> 6.0 and did a brand new install, and things are back in order (sort of).<br />
<span class="caps">CFMX</span> 6.1 is a heck of a lot faster than 6.0, which pleases me of course, although now that I did a fresh install, there are broken bits all over the place that will take me an hour or two to reconstitute.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night we went to a church Christmas program and listened to various choirs sing Christmas hymns, and during one of the hymns, this one old guy in the choir caught my attention. I sat and watched him, and thought &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I could ever describe to anyone how that man is singing.&#8221; I thought about it on the way to work, and I&#8217;m at least going to try.</p>
<p>The man was shaking the words of the songs out of his head. It was as if each note he was hitting had to first be pushed up and out of his body like the last bit of an Otter Pop that&#8217;s unfortunately slid to the bottom of the sheath. Once the man had squeezed the word up to the end of his neck, a fast, almost violent snap would be required to fling the word out. Like a Christmas stocking, rather than reach in for the final goodies, he&#8217;d take the stocking by the toe and flop it about, hoping something might fall out. I&#8217;m also reminded of how the great Orca killer whale flings it&#8217;s prey about for sport, but it doesn&#8217;t quite fit the analogy, although the visual fits very well.</p>
<p>This man&#8217;s style was so peculiar that I&#8217;ve decided that I too will sing like that from now on. There must be something to &#8220;warming&#8221; the words of the song up like he would. It&#8217;s like watching a set of waves coming in &#8211; while one might be breaking on the shore, you can see the swells that will soon become waves in the distance. I&#8217;d say his trick was to have the next four words in the hopper and well massaged ahead of time. I, however, will modify his style. I will avoid swinging my head about so violently, because I fear for anyone standing near me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t care what you say about the ills of reality TV, I&#8217;m still enthralled with Survivor. And the pirate theme, man, that&#8217;s great. It is, in fact, the year of the pirate. I really do think it&#8217;s a great show, and I think anyone who moans and cries about how awful it is just doesn&#8217;t watch a whole season of it. And there&#8217;s nothing finer than sitting down to a Survivor episode and watching it commercial free with a little help from my friend, TiVo.<br />
And if you (Chad at work) think Jon is the best Survivor ever, then line up so I poke your eyes out too. That man makes my bones twist. He pretended that his Grandmother died to gain sympathy, and to protect himself from getting voted off the island! And then he swears on her grave! And then insists that others swear on their children when making agreements with him! He revels in deceit, and really, I should be able to at the very least give his neck a squeeze and maybe punch him in the forehead. It&#8217;s violent, I know, but really, can&#8217;t I just please do that?<br />
Anyhow, I&#8217;m really excited because Chad at work suggested that the next one is going to be an Allstar Survivor. I gotta see Big Tom up against Rupert.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a slow computer at work, and find myself waiting for it to catch up with the light speed calculations of my ever growing head. Instead of staring into blank space, or coming up with fantastical plans of destroying the computer with elegant sword play or explosive martial arts, I&#8217;ve taken up Rubik&#8217;s cube.</p>
<p>But the cube, it defies me. I try, and I try, and yet, here it sits, a multi colored mess. I know there are strategies, and that once you understand it, it becomes easier and easier. I&#8217;m avoiding all strategies at this point. I simply must be capable of solving the puzzle without help. I come from a smart chain of people, certainly a Rubik&#8217;s cube <b>toy</b> shouldn&#8217;t be able to stump me.</p>
<p>The irony is that I&#8217;m always about two steps away from solving it when my computer becomes ready for me again, and then the solution forgotten the next time I pick it up the cube. Or, as seems to be happening more often, someone  scrambles it even further when I&#8217;m not looking. I can only assume it&#8217;s done out of spite of my good looks and undeniable charm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know, I guess it was a few days ago I spent about 23.4 seconds making a fix that I should have done years ago to my blog. I made the URLs Search Engine Friendly, or <span class="caps">SEF</span> for those who work for a corporation like Xerox where if it isn&#8217;t an acronym, it&#8217;s indistinguishable from any other combination of random words.</p>
<p>So how does this benefit me? I&#8217;m not even sure, but everyone has been doing it for years, and I have this sneaky fear that if I don&#8217;t conform I&#8217;ll be made fun of. Also, I&#8217;ve noticed that <a href="http://www.toottoot.org/">certain</a> <a href="http://mx.blogs.com/">sites</a> seem to rank much higher in Google than this here site (deep southern accent), even though this here site has far more incoming links.</p>
<p>Seriously, search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=sore+neck&amp;btnG=Google+Search">sore neck</a>, and you get <a href="http://www.toottoot.org/">toottoot.org</a> in slot three. This isn&#8217;t right! As far as I know, <a href="http://www.toottoot.org/">toottoot.org</a> has been around for only a few months, and has no one linking to it. It&#8217;s one of Google&#8217;s biggest flaws in my opinion. But whatever, now I&#8217;m going to go after a slice of that tasty pie because I have <span class="caps">SEF</span>!</p>
<p>But, since I&#8217;ve tugged the very mesh that holds my site together in Google&#8217;s eyes right out, I&#8217;m afraid that Google is going to freak out. I left the old URLs in tact to keep any old links working from the outside world, but I&#8217;m not sure if that will be good enough for Google when it comes calling. I&#8217;ve gritted my teeth, furrowed my brow, and have resigned to losing my Google rankings entirely, with the thought that perhaps it will turn back around, and work out better in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a man break, dislocate, or in other words, seriously misconfigure his ankle last night at a skateboarding photography session. I took a photo of it of course, but that&#8217;s not one I&#8217;ll widely share, out of respect for the man who&#8217;s ankle now bends at a very unnatural angle.</p>
<p><a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> came along to try out his <a href="http://tenyearsofmylife.com/2003/11/28/">new <span class="caps">SLR</span></a>, and he managed to <a href="http://tenyearsofmylife.com/2003/12/04/">take a shot</a> a hair before I did of the <a href="http://mx.blogs.com/photos/skate/dsc_5460_cropped.html">same subject</a>. I know it&#8217;s not some insane feat for that to happen, but I think it&#8217;s great. While our environment and the circumstances surrounding the moment were the same, we both took pretty different shots.</p>
<p>Needless to say, after the ankle rearrangment, people weren&#8217;t too enthused to push it, so we called it a night.</p>
