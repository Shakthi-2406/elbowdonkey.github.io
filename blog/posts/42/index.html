  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a girl who sits not too far from me at work, and she&#8217;s got a problem.</p>
<p>When she sneezes, she sneezes about fifty times in a row. As if that weren&#8217;t bad enough, she sneezes violently. She flails, sneezes, spits, gags, sneezes&nbsp;and then curses afterwards. She makes a ton of noise, and it&#8217;s begining to push me over the edge. I&#8217;m going to write a memo that says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you need to stop sneezing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And leave it in her cube when she&#8217;s not looking. I&#8217;d rather have someone&nbsp;<a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/home.cfm?id=361" target="">grunting</a> <p>in the cube next to me than have to hear her almost die again.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think living in England might have something to do with my new hates &#8211; here&#8217;s a current list:</p>
<p>Women with rolls on their necks. I know, inner beauty, blah blah. If you&#8217;ve let a roll sneak up and begin to strangle you around the neck, you&#8217;ve been spending more time eating than you have spent working out. I saw three yesterday alone.</p>
<p>People who let boogers fly out of their noses when speaking to you. This is unacceptable. Proper booger management must be employed before speaking to me.</p>
<p>American television. It&#8217;s all very bad. Which isn&#8217;t to say UK television is good, it&#8217;s just better than American television, like a slap in the face is better than a punch in the ear.</p>
<p>Stop lights. Stop signs. Speed Bumps.</p>
<p>Unduly tan and overly bubbly real estate agents who say &#8220;Shurrruh&#8221; randomly. I can only assume it means &#8220;sure&#8221;, which still doesn&#8217;t make sense when showing a house.</p>
<p>Office cubicles. Seriously, they kill production. People hide in their caves until someone has built up enough motivation to send them something to work on. They stifle any social interaction. You can sit three feet away from somebody for years, and never even give them a &#8220;hello, I acknowledge your existance&#8221; nod in the morning.</p>
<p>American television, again. <span class="caps">ABC</span> is going to show the World Broadcast Premier of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, which actually, really, just means &#8220;Movie playing wherever <span class="caps">ABC</span> broadcasts, which really only means in the States&#8221;. &#8220;World Broadcast&#8221; is idiotic. I never noticed it before going to the UK.</p>
<p>People who aspire to look, act, and be like gang bangers. So you spend four years in higher education, get a job that pays good, then you buy a car with axle exstensions and low profile tires. For your Ford Focus. You wear a bandana under a trucker hat, sag your pants, wear a studded wrist band, and try your best to look like you&#8217;re out of the &#8216;hood. And you&#8217;re as white as my inner thigh. No disrespect to real gang bangers who would probably like to escape the &#8217;hood and get as far away from it as possible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Paul Ford has included a <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/TheMoralCharacterOfTheMonkey.html">story about monkeys</a> written by some Reverand in the 1800&#8217;s. I think the story is great &#8211; it&#8217;s well written, very descriptive, and makes me never want to have a monkey as a pet ever again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve put up a new website. I shall call it <a href="http://mx.blogs.com">mx.blogs.com</a>. It&#8217;s a weblog that specifically follows Macromedia products and goings on in that community, which includes Flash, ColdFusion, Dreamweaver, Director, and whatever else I&#8217;m able to get my hands and refer to or talk about Macromedia related.<br />
I end up talking so much about ColdFusion and similar things daily, and ready about stuff, that I need to keep track of it all, and hopefully this will help me do it.<br />
Have a look, and let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I often resist and fail&nbsp;the urge to send instant messages that start off with any of the following or more:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude, I got bit by a wild animal just now&#8230;&#8221;<br />&#8220;Hey, you busy? I need to show you a picture of my swollen ankle.&#8221;<br />&#8220;I figured out why my eyes&nbsp;were bleeding.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Someone just threw a spear at me.&#8221;<br />&#8220;I just saw [celebrity] picking a wedgie&#8221;<br />&#8220;Did I mention the story about the seagull?&#8221;<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m watching a bank robbery&#8221;<br />&#8220;You&#8217;d never guess what just hit my windshield&#8221;<br />&#8220;When they say flame retardent, they mean it!&#8221;</p>
<p>None of them are ever completely true, or even close to true for that matter, but I can&#8217;t think of any other way to kickstart an instant message conversation. I have this problem. I will look at my buddy list for a good five minutes fighting myself. It usually goes like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have nothing important to say to this person. They&#8217;re probably working. They might be up using the toilet. Maybe they&#8217;re on the phone. Don&#8217;t disturb them. You&#8217;re just trying to find a diversion. Get back to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the fantastic lines that win the arguments with myself. &#8220;But if I talk about how I just saw&nbsp;a man jack hammer his foot clean off, then whatever I&#8217;ve interrupted will seem less important. Everyone wants to hear about something gruesome or fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the secret is out. If I send you a message, just humour my delusions. Say &#8220;Wow, no kidding&#8221; and &#8220;Gee, that must have been scary&#8221; or &#8220;Good thing you aren&#8217;t allergic&#8221;, etc. Follow that up with &#8220;Now don&#8217;t you have work to do?&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, a fork lift just drove through my office wall. I&#8217;ll have to listen to your story about how you fell into an eight foot deep pit and couldn&#8217;t get out for a week another time.&#8221; Counter attack with guilt or something else fantastic or impossible. I won&#8217;t mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet again I&#8217;m thinking about consuming <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/home.cfm?id=480" target="">10,000 feeds</a><p>.</p><br />
<p>The thing is, while I see it intriguing to have tons of data at my fingertips, I can&#8217;t yet think of anything new or exciting to do with the data. Sure, I&#8217;ll be able to quickly search for stuff. Maybe find new blogs, make contact with some interesting people based on those discoveries, but I want more than that.</p><br />
<p>I want to be like Lex Luther, and feel like I have some evil power over everyone else because I was clever enough to do the job, and then I want to laugh with my fist out in front of me, crushing the air. And I want a jaunty suit and either no hair, or at least a sharp haircut.</p><br />
<p>I want my billions to be made off of selling a new soft drink, the design of which I extrapolated from the 10,000 weblogs, marketing the drink with the very&nbsp;engine that came up with the formula to begin with.</p><br />
<p>And then I want a putting green. 8 feet by 10 feet, with real Astro Turf.</p><br />
<p>And a Segway with flames on it.</p><br />
<p>And you might think I&#8217;m being sarcastic. Perhaps making a satire of what marketing entities think of blogs, but I kid you not. I want a Lex Luther suit, and the means to get there is by consuming every known feed to man and turning it into my very own Golden Goose.</p><br />
<p>So, any ideas for what I can do with this data?</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate my Toshiba&#8217;s touchpad. I just spent exactly fourty-five minutes drafting the most important weblog entry of all time and history ad infinitum, and with the slightest finger twitch, closed the composition window.</p>
<p>I am however still mystified that it can even work. How it knows I&#8217;m touching it is simply marvelous and beyond my comprehension. But I say that, and yet I have a vague and half made up understanding of how it works, but I&#8217;m not so sure I want to know the true story. Just tell me it has something to do with nanotechnology and I won&#8217;t hate it anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After spending the weekend at <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/">Erik</a>&#8216;s place, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I can be a better web surfer if I use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/release-notes.html">Firebird </a>(the stripped down Mozilla browser). It renders <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> closer to the W3C specification than IE, and has far more features.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve forced myself to use it by removing all buttons to IE, making Firebird my default browser, and turning off email previews in Outlook. So far, I hardly notice I&#8217;m using a different browser.</p>
<p>Once I do some customizations of Firebird, I&#8217;ll begin to really reap the benefits. Tabbed browsing, customizable interface, and lower memory usage should all start helping me become a super hero.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been driving. A lot.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been taking the long way to Oregon from California where&nbsp;we left our only vehicle before leaving for England. We&#8217;ve managed to only stay in two motels on our now five day journey, and one of those motels was because we were rained out of a campsite in southern Utah. Rain drops the size of water balloons. Ear splitting thunder. Hail. You would escape it too if the fury of mother nature was being unleashed above you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now in Boise, visiting friends. Our daughter has her first ever fever, and is nearly walking after seeing an almost&nbsp;two year old walking with such ease. I&#8217;m using a broadband connection for the first time in exactly four months. It&#8217;s like breathing fresh air after breathing with your head buried in sand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought little of technology &#8211; it&#8217;s been the last thing on my mind. Not only am I still fighting jetlag, but I&#8217;m more concerned about staying awake while driving on endless roads than I am worried about things like <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds or web services.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we make our way home, over the Cascades into our lush Willamette valley home. We&#8217;ve been gone so long, we&#8217;re really looking forward to holding still, at least for a few weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>1. Lose or have your wallet stolen a week before moving back to the States from England. Threaten the bank person on the phone, suggesting that you will starve to death, and it&#8217;s his fault because the company he works for can&#8217;t get a piece of plastic to the UK in less than 3 weeks. Give up as he simply ignores you on the phone in deadly agonizing silence. <strong>[-20]</strong></p>
<p>2. Wait until the last second to clean up the house and pack. Realize with just an hours wiggle room that you need to be at the airport an hour early. <strong>[-3]</strong></p>
<p>3. Sit next to a huge Danish dude who insists on carrying on a conversation with you in what can only be assumed is his native tongue. Nod emphatically. <strong>[-1]</strong></p>
<p>4. Miss out on being bumped from your flight in exchange for 800 Euros, a free night at a 5 star hotel, meal vouchers, and a tour of Copenhagen by one person. <strong>[-4]</strong></p>
<p>5. Get seated next to a man who bears a striking resemblance to Hitler. Note the Hitler style mustache, mannerisms, slicked back hair, eyes, soon to be jowls, choice of language. <strong>[-1]</strong></p>
<p>6. Watch as nearly a quarter of everyone on the plane floats for a few seconds a foot out of their seats as the plane freefalls for a thousand feet in heavy turbulence, including Hitler. Remain guilt ridden the rest of the flight for thinking it funny that the Hitler look alike had a glob of Cognac from his meal float right into his face and neck. <strong>[+6]</strong></p>
<p>7. Tell the customs official that you&#8217;ve been on &#8220;holiday&#8221; for 4 months. Immediately regret using such a British word for &#8220;vacation&#8221;. Listen to questions such as &#8220;so, did you go to Amsterdam&#8221; even though you have no stamps to the country of Holland in your passport, or &#8220;so why are you so lucky that you get to spend 4 months in England&#8221; or &#8220;why are your eyes red&#8221;. Do your best not to headlock the gentleman and run him head first into Hitler, who is now throwing his hands up in the air and screaming in a Hitler fashion at his customs agent. <strong>[-10]</strong></p>
<p>8. Get pulled from the customs line. Make sure that every item in every piece of baggage is scrutinized and swabbed for explosives. This includes loose change in the bottom of the luggage that&#8217;s been there for years. This includes dirty socks, and ear plugs. Practice new answers to the same questions asked by the previous customs agents. Do not use the word holiday. <strong>[-15]</strong></p>
<p>9. Watch as the guy re-checking your bags writes the wrong flight number on the tags. Assume he&#8217;s smarter than you, and knows what he&#8217;s doing. <strong>[-4]</strong></p>
<p>10. Wait for your luggage to not show up in Portland. <strong>[-20]</strong></p>
<p>11. Go to the hotel where you&#8217;ve not only reserved a room, but paid for it too, and let them tell you they don&#8217;t have your reservation on file. Wait for an hour as they decide whether or not to let you pay in good hard cash. <strong>[-10]</strong></p>
<p>12. Wake up bright and early with the intention of renting a car sans drivers license (which was stolen a week before) and major credit card (same). Spend 3 hours waiting for a background check to go through for a car. Drive off the lot in a sort of purple/blue Kia. A girl car, yes, but a car. <strong>[+5]</strong></p>
<p>13. Sigh with relief when luggage shows up at the hotel. <strong>[+20]</strong></p>
<p>14. Drive to the apartment complex to finish signing papers for new apartment. Be genuinely unsurprised when they don&#8217;t have the slightest idea who you are, even though you&#8217;ve sent them checks and signed paperwork via fax. <strong>[-10]</strong></p>
<p>15. Laugh nervously when the leasing agent finds your file, and says &#8220;Sorry, it&#8217;s right here. It&#8217;s Monday, and things keep happening like this to me. I&#8217;m having the worst day&#8221;. <strong>[+5]</strong></p>
<p>16. Set eyes on a brand new, never lived in apartment built only months ago. Drop jaw as you take in the immense size of it, having been used to a bedroom that can literally only fit a double bed. Wipe tears from your eyes as you take in the view &#8211; a forest with several Douglas Fir trees and all sorts of other trees, with rolling green hills beyond. Notice the toilets that flush properly, the faucets that premix the hot and cold water, the lights that work, the windows with screens, the fireplace that turns on with the flick of a switch. Break down and cry like a baby when seeing the Ethernet, phone line, satellite, and cable port in every room, including on the space above the fireplace where a TV and Tivo should go, and in the kitchen. <strong>[+60]</strong></p>
<p>17. Wake up in the morning to take a refreshing shower, and realize that the natural gas hasn&#8217;t been turned on, therefore leaving you with ice cold water. <strong>[-10]</strong></p>
<p>18. Turn on the UK mobile phone to see what time it is in the UK, just out of curiosity, and within seconds answer an incoming call. Melt with relief when the person on the other end says they&#8217;ve found your wallet. Arrange to have it sent via internal company mail within 2 days <strong>[+100]</strong></p>
<p>19. Tally up the scores, and overall, the trip earned a +83, despite all the bad things.</p>
