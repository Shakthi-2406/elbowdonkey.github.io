  <div class="entry-content"><p>MT could have a key that you entered. With that key, it would take the blog ID entry, and your key, and encrypt the form fields and form actions for each blog entry so no two comment forms would be alike. No comment spam bot in hell would be able to figure that one out, and MT would carry on without issue.</p>
<p>The only thing a comment spam bot could do is scrape the page with the form elements, and assume it was a comments form, and try posting data to each element anyhow, hoping for the best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I sat down to write a comment spam bot, you&#8217;d better believe I&#8217;d be gunning for Moveable Type first. It has huge widespread adoption, and only up until the most recent releases, allowed anyone, including my simple bot, to post comments to blog entries. Because of the correlation with highly popular weblogs with very ripe page ranks and the use of MT, I&#8217;d be even more motivated to figure out a way to get my links on MT blogs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll even make the argument that because of the rapid and widespread adoption of MT by prominent bloggers that comment spamming as a practice came about and became rewarding.</p>
<p>That said, I think I have a solution for comment spam (I&#8217;ll receive 150+ before this sentence is finished) that has worked for me in the recent past:</p>
<p>Allow me to name the form fields and form actions responsible for posting comments in MT. Make it possible for me to make my MT installation to look like some random home brewed application and I&#8217;ll bet that I&#8217;ll stop getting comment spam instantly.</p>
<p>I say this with some confidence because up until very recently, I was running on a home brewed blogging application, and for almost five years only got comments from real human beings (far more than I do today, I might add) and never once from a bot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other morning I cut the tip of my nose while shaving. I know, it&#8217;s completely stupid, and I can hardly believe it myself. I was just moving the razor from one side of my face to the other, and there was my nose, getting nosy. So as I type this, I have a double gash in the tip of nose (cheap dual bladed razors!).</p>
<p>Leah saw me trying to stop the blood and was super curious (as two year olds are) about what was going on. I explained to her, and she offered all sorts of condolences, offered to kiss the nose, fetched me tissues, etc.</p>
<p>Later on during the day, she floored Carrie and I with something she said, nose related. I can&#8217;t remember what we were talking about. I think we were getting ready to go somewhere, and normally she might say &#8220;And Daddy too?&#8221;, hoping that instead of having to work, I&#8217;d be joining them for their adventure.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;And Daddy too?&#8221;, she said &#8220;and Daddy with his nose so bright&#8221;. Cut nose. Red nose, Rudolph with your nose so bright, won&#8217;t you guide my sleigh tonight? Carrie and I were, as I said, floored. Hopefully Leah reads this in 10 years and realizes why we were both laughing so hard.</p>

We&#8217;re starting to notice a very distinct and enthusiastic personality in him that&#8217;s different than Leah&#8217;s, thought just as exciting.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about Apple&#8217;s marketing strategy lately and I can&#8217;t seem to tell if it&#8217;s really cool or has a touch of pure evil running through it.</p>
<p>Consider the last few weeks. <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+suit+foreshadows+coming+products/2100-1047_3-5513582.html">Apple files suit</a> against a <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/">website</a> that exposes rumors about Macintosh products. Within a week or so of the suit, they reveal the exact products that the rumor site talked about. Kind of silly right? Maybe not so &#8211; maybe kind of brilliant.</p>
<p>During Steve Job&#8217;s keynote presentation at MacWorld he slowly ramped up his speech to two new products that the rumor site had suggested were coming &#8211; the iPod Shuffle and the Mac Mini. Before even revealing the Mac Mini you could tell people knew what was coming. Steve smiled after talking about the iMac sales figures, and people knew what was coming. Steve knew they knew what was coming. He was as gleeful as he could get.</p>
<p>If I put myself in Steve&#8217;s shoes, I have two core principles that I must follow to satisfy my shareholders. I must make products or provide services that capture market share and at the same time do it as inexpensively as possible.</p>
<p>Now, still in Steve&#8217;s shoes, I consider my options. I have this new product coming and it totally rocks, but I&#8217;m torn by the fact that in order to sell this product with already low to nonexistent margins, I have to eat into to some real money to let people know about it. If only I could avoid that. So I study the buzz. Insiders have leaked information about my new product, so people already seem to have an idea of what I&#8217;m trying to make a splash with. But they&#8217;re also talking about all sorts of other things, leaving it up to those who know my secrets best to rise to the top with some reasonable conjecture about why their rumors beat all.</p>
<p>So I sue them. It&#8217;s fruit hanging so low I can kick it. My salaried lawyers are essentially free because I budget for them and pay for them anyhow, and the cost of filing suit is essentially free less FedEx shipping charges and court fees &#8211; all microscopic compared to sending out a press release about my products. By suing the most legit of all the rumor sites, I create a huge buzz. Everyone who cares is talking about how the suit lends legitimacy to the claims. People are outraged, people are excited, people anticipate my big reveal. The publicity alone is priceless, but in addition, I didn&#8217;t have to let the cat out of the bag.</p>
<p>So when I&#8217;m standing there, my finger on the &#8220;Next Slide&#8221; button, looking at the faces of the attendees, I know they know, and they know I know they know, and everyone revels in the little secret for just a second more. And when I reveal the Mac Mini, everyone is so pleased that my company did the right thing and revealed the product that everyone was hoping I&#8217;d reveal and immediately begin blogging the radness, and calling their aunts, and running the to the Apple store and generally work up a healthy froth.</p>
<p>And all of that is either totally awesome, or a touch of pure evil, or both.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another thought: the standard slot for car stereos (<span class="caps">DIN</span>) is 2&quot; tall by 7&quot; wide, with varying front to back room, but usually at least around 7&quot;. The Mini Mac is 2&quot; tall by 6.5&quot; wide, by 6.5&quot; deep. If someone came out with a touch screen <span class="caps">LCD</span> &#8220;radio face plate&#8221; sized screen that plugged into the standard <span class="caps">VGA</span> port and figured out the power issues, you&#8217;d have yourself one hell of a car stereo.</p>
<p>Put WiFi in the Mini Mac and you could keep all your audio synced with your car while you slept. Hook up a <span class="caps">GPS</span> and you&#8217;ve got a navigation system. Add Bluetooth and you can piggyback on your mobile phone&#8217;s data connection. Turn on OS X&#8217;s built in voice recognition and tell your stereo what to do.</p>
<p>You could really do some cool stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m pretty excited about the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> goodies announced this morning.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mini Mac</a> is great &#8211; from a business perspective I think it&#8217;s a piece that Apple has been missing from the very beginning &#8211; a Mac that competes on every level with a PC. Take the price and performance alone, and this competes with any PC on the market. But check out the size on this thing &#8211; it&#8217;s super tiny. With a footprint just slightly bigger than a CD and only two inches tall, it&#8217;s very small.</p>
<p>In the space my G5 takes up, I think I could fit at least 8 Mini Macs. And make no mistake &#8211; someone will be detailing a cluster of Mac Minis shortly.</p>
<p>I think the new super tiny <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a> is a good move as well &#8211; super cheap, super tiny, and it doesn&#8217;t try to replace the full size iPods.</p>
<p>One thing that doesn&#8217;t make sense though is why did they reveal these products after Christmas? Especially the new iPod. Erik and I were talking about it, and he said a bunch of family members got flash based players for Christmas, and someone in my family got a G4 iBook (when the Mac Mini would have done just fine). Both of these products are perfectly priced as gifts &#8211; why&#8217;d they wait?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been seeing little snippets around the web of these 100 things, but this is the first time I&#8217;ve seen the full list. Some of my favorites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>19. The collective noun for rhinos is &#8220;crash&#8221;.</p>
<p>42. Running a car costs the average motorist £101 a week, according to the <span class="caps">RAC</span>.</p>
<p>47. A &#8220;jiffy&#8221; is 10 milliseconds in computer science terms.</p>
<p>97. Matt Groening&#8217;s father &#8211; the inspiration for Homer Simpson &#8211; has only complained once about his alter-ego&#8217;s actions. It was an episode in which Homer badgered Marge into walking some considerable distance on a hot day to fetch him something.</p>
<p>100. Bill Clinton sent just two e-mails while he was president.</p>
