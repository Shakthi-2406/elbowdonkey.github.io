  <div class="entry-content"><p>The US has stepped up and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/12/31/us.aid/">pledged $350M</a>, a serious pile of money, towards relief efforts. I&#8217;m curious though, and I haven&#8217;t been able to get more details yet, but is that $350M a cash donation, or is it a line of credit? Does anyone know?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was disturbed by what seems like a huge disparity between what the US can give and is actually giving to tsunami damaged countries. I put together a table that contains a country&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product (<span class="caps">GDP</span>) compared to what that country&#8217;s government has recently pledged towards relief efforts, and the percentage of the <span class="caps">GDP</span> that that pledge is.</p>
<p>Comparing the donation to <span class="caps">GDP</span> isn&#8217;t exactly fair considering that <span class="caps">GDP</span> doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;cash on hand&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s more of a country&#8217;s &#8220;cash producing potential&#8221;. But looking at <span class="caps">GDP</span> definitely gives you an idea of which countries are wealthy, and which countries aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Also to consider, the donation amounts are cash. As best I could, I removed any figures that included food and medical supplies or other non-cash contributions (such as sending teams in, or vehicles, etc). I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake">this Wikipedia Page</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html"><span class="caps">CIA</span> World Factbook</a> to build the table. The countries are sorted by percentage of <span class="caps">GDP</span> donated in descending order.</p>

<p>Most disturbing to me is that some of the wealthiest countries are contributing less, dollar for dollar, than countries far less wealthy.</p>
<p>Also, I keep seeing on the news that Spain is contributing $69M, which isn&#8217;t true. Nearly all of that $69M is a loan. Loans are not charity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Andy is hosting several <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/12/28/amateur_.shtml">videos taken by tourists</a> of the tsunamis. Very quickly you get an idea of why the death toll is so high. The first one of Phuket in Thailand is terrifying.</p>
<p>For some reason news agencies aren&#8217;t showing footage like this, and I can&#8217;t say if they should or shouldn&#8217;t be. On one hand, seeing this makes me realize, in part, the scope of the disaster, but on the other hand seeing enough of these videos could desensitize me. Even with four videos, by the fourth one you know a big wave is going to come and reap destruction on the coastline and it just doesn&#8217;t seem to drive it home like the first one does.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone uses <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr.com</a> lately, or at least everyone who I have been paying attention to recently. I&#8217;ve known about it and have had the opportunity to use it since it&#8217;s infancy, but haven&#8217;t because of a few reasons that I&#8217;m just now beginning to realize. Some of them I think are flickr.com shortcomings, and others, just shortcomings with digital imaging in general:</p>
<p>1. My photos end up in a common flickr theme. Beyond my photographs and comments, there isn&#8217;t much that says &#8220;These are Michael&#8217;s photos&#8221;. The interface is fine, and essential, but I&#8217;d love to be able to modify the template to look more like my site. But that&#8217;s not how flickr works, and I understand that. Changing that suggests a change in how flickr works.</p>
<p>2. I hate uploading photographs to websites. Uploading a single photograph at a time is excruciating, not because of the time it takes to do it, but because of all the mouse clicks, and searching for the file. That sucks. I&#8217;m not sure if flickr does this, but Typepad has the best workaround &#8211; zip up a batch of photographs and upload a single file and it unzips and places the photos in a gallery. But even that sucks. I&#8217;m wishing a bit too hard here, but I want my digital <span class="caps">SLR</span> camera to be able to connect to some ubiquitous high speed wireless network no matter where I am and put the just taken photo in an album. Camera phones nearly have that ability now, but I want more. This isn&#8217;t flickr&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b><br />
flickr has batch upload clients that take the sting off of upload, but I want to process to be transparent. I basically want iPhoto Pro (which doesn&#8217;t exist, but would be a more feature rich version iPhoto for people like myself who take massive quantities of huge file size photos in <span class="caps">RAW</span> format) to speak directly to my web enabled photo software. Like a web based iPhoto mirror that synchronizes on the fly without me having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>3. flickr, due to it&#8217;s popularity, put the skids on a really cool web based game. My warped thinking says &#8220;Don&#8217;t use flickr, and Game Never Ending will come back&#8221; which is probably as true as Astrology.</p>
<p>4. Say flickr or type flickr enough times and your mind turns it into something fowl sounding. It&#8217;s not a euphemism for anything, it just sounds like something I&#8217;d say after falling down a flight of stairs. Not sure if that&#8217;s flickr&#8217;s fault or mine.</p>

<p>This guy creates this huge elaborate hoax saying that you can control his Christmas lights from the web and now admits it was a hoax. He went as far as putting extension cords to his neighbors&#8217; trees and getting them in on it, and putting up changing &#8220;web cam&#8221; photos showing subtle changes to lead people to believe the shot was live. He went to a ton of work to keep up the hoax.</p>
<p>Thing is, why the hoax? It seems like what he was doing to keep it up was far more difficult than actually just making it happen for real. Even if he was inept at computers, sure he knows someone who could figure out how to make it happen. Finding that person must be easier than keeping up the hoax.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last hour or so reading about the tsunamis that hit the coasts of the Indian Ocean, and I&#8217;m slowly beginning to understand the gravity of the situation. I&#8217;ve also thought a lot about why something like September 11th had such a greater hold over me than the destruction that the tsunamis caused.</p>
<p>On September 11th I saw things get destroyed that I had been to very recently prior to the destruction there. I&#8217;d stood on top of one of the the World Trade Center towers and had been floored by their massive size. I&#8217;d stood among tourists and locals around the base and fallen in love with Manhattan within days of being there. Seeing those buildings destroyed and seeing footage of places I knew and video of people who I felt like I knew having been in their city made it all very real.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to Sri Lanka or India, and while I&#8217;ve known people who have lived there and have family there now, making that sort of &#8220;real&#8221; connection I had with <span class="caps">NYC</span> is far more difficult. Reading first hand accounts is helping bridge that gap, and is helping motivate me to do what I can to ease the suffering of those hit by the disaster. Here are some of the things I found that have made an impact on how I feel about the situation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=61613&amp;headline=%91I~was~being~swept~out~to~sea,~I~felt~afraid,~powerless%92">&#8216;I was being swept out to sea, I felt afraid, powerless&#8217;</a><br />

<p>This isn&#8217;t something I can ignore &#8211; the immediate death toll statistics are staggering, but as the days go on, it will surely rise due to the spread of disease, lack of clean water and food and basic medical care.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll take the observation one step further and suggest that weblogs without timestamps aren&#8217;t weblogs*.</p>
<ul>
	<li>By saying this, I break my own rules with <a href="http://digitalslr.org">digitalslr.org</a> because it has no timestamps.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a well deserved reputation of destroying cars. First, there was the engine of the Datsun 510 that exploded as I was driving. The oil pump failed, and the pistons seized up, throwing an entire piston out through the side of the engine. Then there was the Buick with its failing brakes and the engine that fell off its mounts. Then there was the Honda <span class="caps">CRX</span> that suffered a cracked engine block, also oil related.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why when I bought my latest car I shelled out the extra money for a super special extended warranty, though at the time I just felt like it was worth the extra $1000 financed just for some extra peace of mind. The two new cars previous to that hadn&#8217;t needed it, but given that I used to average a car a year, it wasn&#8217;t such a bad idea.</p>
<p>At the end of a 12 hour drive recently, I noticed a sort of burning oil smell. I checked the oil, and there was none showing on the dip stick. Great &#8211; not even 6,000 miles on the car yet, and something is seriously wrong. I had gotten a full oil change a week or two before the drive.</p>
<p>I bought some oil, put 2 bottles in, and checked it the next morning. Oil showed on the stick, no oil on the road, all seemed well. I drove about 15 miles, and noticed that smoke was seeping out of the hood from the engine. When you see this, know that something is wrong. An engine should never issue forth smoke.</p>
<p>I pulled over, noticed a stream of oil dripping from the engine on the parking lot, called the road side assistance number, and got the car towed to the nearest dealer. They called a few hours later with a shocking story.</p>
<p>They told me that the last place I had my oil changed removed my stock oil filter (the evidence of wrench marks were there), but instead of replacing it had put it back on my car. In the process they&#8217;d punctured the oil filter. The hole in the oil filter must have gotten progressively larger, and finally failed to the point where it was pouring out oil when I pulled it off the road.</p>
<p>Luckily there was no damage overall, but the oil change place definitely put me in serious danger of breaking down in the middle of some snowy mountain pass hundreds of miles from the nearest anything. I expect that I&#8217;ll ask them to pay me for the oil change they charged me for originally, as well as the oil change I ultimately had to pay the dealer to perform. It&#8217;s about the most I think I can ask for, despite the danger they put me in.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re not into that, I&#8217;ll spend my Saturday afternoons carrying a sign in front of the business saying &#8220;This place nearly made my new car explode, come ask me how&#8221; and tell people my story until the oil change place sees things clearly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a new game. Use the <a href="http://www.kleimo.com/random/name.cfm">random name generator</a> to generate 5 names, then weave those five names into a story. Here&#8217;s a quickie:</p>
<p>Lawrence Coley made the mistake of braking too hard on the ice covered road, and promptly spun his rented Lincoln Towncar into the back end of Joseph Kearns&#8217; Ford Explorer.</p>
<p>George Burden watched the scene from the restaurant window and chuckled as he took a sip of coffee while still chewing on his danish. The mingling of danish and coffee was satisfying to him and was something he did out of habit without giving much thought beyond his recognition that it was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Debra Rupert thought her partner was classless, and had given up telling him that his chewing and sipping was supremely disgusting long ago. She was the first to stand, and as she headed away from the table towards the door she threw a hand into George&#8217;s shoulder and said &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>George grabbed his coat and followed Debra out the door to the accident. He was a year away from retirement and preferred sorting out simple things like fender benders more than he did chasing down bad guys. Especially in the dead of winter. Debra had only been in the force for five years or so, and was always the first to act, which suited George well. He was done making big decisions and found himself thinking more about sipping Martinis by the pool in Cocoa Beach, getting out of Jersey for good. He&#8217;d play canasta, or whatever it is that retirees do.</p>
<p>Rose Stearns had been working at this restaurant for two years now and had gotten used to seeing George and Debra every morning. At first she was intimidated by the cops but had began to see them as friends. Though she was hardly a dangerous criminal, Rose and her boyfriend had been building up a nest egg selling pirated software at flea markets. They&#8217;d never been questioned about the legitimacy of their products before &#8211; their customers knew that a $10.00 copy of Windows wasn&#8217;t legit, so she felt less guilty about the deed. Her customers were just as guilty as she was.</p>
<p>Rose hadn&#8217;t seen the accident, and was concerned when she saw the officers leave without paying. But as she hurried to their table she saw why they&#8217;d left, and assumed they&#8217;d come back to pay when they were done. She decided to not clear their table and started to head over to another table to clear it. But she stopped sharp as she spotted something nearly on the edge of her vision. On the booth cushion sat an African Tree Frog, looking up at her with cold eyes. One eye slowly blinked as Rose got closer to look. As she got within a few inches of the frog, it stiffened up, paying a little more attention to it&#8217;s surroundings it seemed. Suddenly, before Rose could react, the frog opened its mouth to an impossible size and swallowed Rose whole.</p>
<hr />

<p>I gave up. But the point is, the random name generator pulled out all sorts of stories when I read the random names. Maybe because they&#8217;re not real names I feel like I can get creative without the name being linked to something. Making up my own names for characters and writing about them is a bit excruciating because the name doesn&#8217;t seem to fit. Also, maybe five names is too many. Three or four seemed ok, but I was having trouble finishing things off with Rose, and making the entire thing a cohesive story. So she got eaten by a frog, which is interesting, but has nothing to do with the rest of the story.</p>
