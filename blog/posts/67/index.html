Sometimes I wish computer companys like Dell and Gateway would direct their marketing dollars towards better advertising that would be geared towards building the brand, rather than pushing this quarter&#8217;s latest package special. </p>
<p>Apple does this very well. Dell does it very poorly with this twitchy&nbsp;twenty-something kid trying to look and act like a teenager. Combine this&nbsp;with the &#8220;Dude, you&#8217;re getting a Dell&#8221; slogan and you get what I call anti-advertising. I now want to buy a Dell less because of this campaign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I believe that one day we will all be zipping around on Segways, sipping carrot juice and folding oragami, I thought it would be prudent, historically speaking, to mark the first recorded Segway related injury.</p>
<p><strong><em>Segway hits bump in its progress</em><p></p><br />
<p><em>The heralded Segway has claimed its first Atlanta victim. A member of the Central Atlanta Progress Ambassador Force toppled from one of the personal scooters on Cone Street near Luckie Street about 8:40 p.m. Thursday.</em></p><br />
<p><em>The officer, whose name was not released, injured his knee going up a driveway onto the sidewalk, said Atlanta Police Sgt. Michael Giugliano. He was taken to Grady Hospital.</em></p><br />
<p><em>Atlanta is one of the first cities to buy into the concept of using the Segway scooters, manufactured out of Manchester, N.H., for use by city employees. </em></p><br />
<p><em>Six of the 65-pound Segway scooters were lent to the Atlanta police for 60 days in late April by the company that are promoting them. Ten more of the machines were purchased for $9,000 each by the city&#8217;s Ambassador Force, Central Atlanta Progress and Georgia Power, according to Atlanta Regional Commission spokeswoman Julie Ralston.</em></p><br />
<p>From the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/metro/0502/03segway.html">Atlanta Journal-Consitution</a>.</p><br />
<p>Personally, I think this fellow who fell didn&#8217;t get the attention he was looking for when becoming one of the first to be able to use the Segway on the job, so he got a little crazy, threw himself off of the perfectly balanced device in order to get some more attention. Shameful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday I saw <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nosewheelie.com/nov/novpics/novpic3.html">Stacey Peralta</a><p>&#8216;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/dogtownandzboys">Dogtown &amp; Z-Boys </a>. The film focused on a particular group of surfers turned skateboarders in the mid seventies that changed skateboarding forever. Had it not been for this crew of skateboarders, skateboarding might be regarded as merely a hula hoop-like trend, lumped into the same category as pet rocks and yoyos.</p><br />
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that the boys from Dogtown gave skateboarding the hard edged look that it still maintains today, rather than the clean cut, pastel look it was beginning to develop. The documentary makes it clear that a group of several young men kept pushing and pushing the sport, building the foundation that is now a rapidly growing and thriving sport shared by 12-15 Million Americans today.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;d suggest checking out the film, even if you care little about skateboarding. I came away being grateful for the freedoms that Americans enjoy. Had this same group of kids grown up elsewhere, I can&#8217;t say they would have succeeded in what they were doing. The film is well designed, flows well, and lives up the acclaim.</p><br />
<p>And to give you an idea of how skateboarding in the 70&#8217;s was getting sucked into the mainstream, check out this old magazine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adflip.com/addetails.cfm?adID=12221&amp;showLargeJpg=Yes">ad</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a target="_blank" href="http://software.xfx.net/utilities/popupkiller/index.html">PopUpKiller</a> <p>is a great little tool that stops&nbsp;annoying popup&nbsp;windows. It&#8217;s no longer being supported by the original programmers, but it is free, and might move into the open source world before too long. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed having it. It kills about 95% of the nasty ad popups, but does just as good at killing acceptable popups. There is a quick way of disabling it for the times when you need to see popups.</p><br />
<p>The company that makes PopUpKiller reccommends downloading Meaya&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meaya.com/download.htm?br">Popup Ad Filter</a>. So I downloaded it, and guess what? It stops working after 30-40 popups (in other words, within 20 minutes) and it doesn&#8217;t support Netscape or Opera.</p><br />
<p>Speaking of annoying ads, check out the craziness on this <a target="_blank" href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/basic.asp?symb=abtl&amp;siteID=mktw&amp;dist=mktwqn">major site</a>. Some have a hard time noticing at first, and some think it&#8217;s a joke, but it&#8217;s all very real.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&quot;David Manning of The Ridgefield Press is one of Columbia Pictures&#8217; most reliable reviewers, praising Heath Ledger of A Knight&#8217;s Tale as this year&#8217;s hottest new star! and saluting The Animal as another winner! The studio plastered Manning&#8217;s raves over at least four different movie advertisements, including Hollow Man and Vertical Limit. But Manning&#8217;s own life story should be called Charade<a target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/583297.asp">because he doesn&#8217;t exist</a><p>. Challenged last week by Newsweek about the reviewer&#8217;s authenticity, Columbia parent Sony Pictures Entertainment admitted that Manning is a fake, a product of the studio&#8217;s advertising department.&quot; Sent by coworker Michael Kitzman.</p><br />
<p>I almost went to work for Sony Columbia Tristar. I always looked forward to the day when I could meet movie critics like David Manning while on the job and say &#8220;Hey man, we&#8217;re kind of in the same business. I make websites for movies, you say what you think of a movie, let&#8217;s go play air hockey.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>My dreams of air hockey with David Manning were obliterated this morning. I can barely go on. I&#8217;ll never watch a Sony movie again, not simply because of Hollow Man. Well, yeah, because of Hollow Man mostly. 97% Hollow Man, 3% David Manning scam.</p><br />
<p><strong>Update: </strong>This story is nearly a year old. I feel that much more stupid for not hearing about it until today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>New site design coming. We&#8217;re not just talking look and feel, the entire guts of the site have been rewritten to my satisfaction. Now I&#8217;m just building the separate sections. I&#8217;ve been wanting to post ColdFusion and How To articles for a while, and pretty soon I&#8217;ll be able to do that. Also, I&#8217;ll be bringing back my illustration portfolio, which I miss. And finally, the photo journal section is being revised (along with weeding out very uninteresting photos, leaving only the good ones).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A freight train <a target="" href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/04/23/california.wreck/index.html">crashed</a> <p>head on into a MetroLink commuter train in my county (not exactly close to where a live, but it was on my way to near where I live). A few questions pop into my head when hearing about this:</p><br />
<ul><br />
<li>There are commuter trains in Southern California? OK, I knew that, but our public transportation is awful. If you don&#8217;t have a car you&#8217;re basically screwed unless you enjoy taking 2 hours to go 20 miles.</li><br />
<li>Why do they share the same tracks? Is it because Southern California is too lazy to build a separate system. My answer: yes. Laziness has cost a few lives.</li><br />
<li>Aren&#8217;t train operators a little more aware of things like this? I&#8217;m not talking about the drivers themselves, but those who control the track switches and such. Surely they have a fancy sensor/computer system that keeps track of where trains are.</li></ul><br />
<p>I think if Southern California had a train/subway system like the <span class="caps">NYC</span> area does (which includes suburbs in New Jersey, Conneticut, and Upstate New York) SoCal would become an incredibly desirable place to do business, to work, and to live. It would change the way we&#8217;re sprawling all over the place, and help establish city centers that work (like Manhattan, which is an incredible city).</p><br />
<p>Perhaps frequent seismic events prohibit extensive subways, but maybe a monorail would be nice? A Segway Freeway? Horses?</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I dropped a link to <a target="_blank" href="http://minimouse.fullmoonwebs.com/">Lorraine O&#8217;Conner&#8217;s</a> <p>site yesterday in my links section&nbsp;after seeing it on <a target="" href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a>&#8216;s site because I truly enjoyed the site. Today it&#8217;s funny because she jabbed Matt because of his description of her blog:</p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;My new favorite weblog is the mousetrap. It&#8217;s written by someone who is 71 years old, and just like talking with my grandparents, the content of the blog centers mostly around the weather and medication.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>She didn&#8217;t like the weather and medication part, thinking it a bit of a stereotype. It&#8217;s true, there is some talk of weather and medication, but that just seems to be recent more recent stuff. Her stories about her cat and are well written, but more importantly, hearing about some of her life experiences are important. </p><br />
<p>That&#8217;s right, important. Lorraine, while younger than my own grandmother, grew up in roughly the same kind of time when America was perhaps a little more innocent, hard working, less spoiled by mass media and marketing. The lessons I&#8217;ve learned from my own grandmother teach me to be grateful for the freedoms I currently enjoy (or take for granted). It was her generation that battled the Great Depression, fought World War II, and raised kids who&#8217;s generation ended up fighting in or opposing the war in Vietnam. It was her generation that witnessed some of the greatest changes in America as technology, science, art, and social change&nbsp;exploded into rapid progression.</p><br />
<p>The wisdom that people like Lorraine can share with those of us currently shaping America is important, and I&#8217;m glad I found her site. What we sometimes see as cranky old lady talk has been shaped by years of trials and triumphs, sorrow and joy. A definate daily read, but not merely for entertainment, but to learn.</p></p>
