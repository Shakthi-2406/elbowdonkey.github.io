  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I had a baby boy a week ago. Carrie didn&#8217;t even break a sweat &#8211; she&#8217;s super fantastic. His name is Jonas, and he weighed in at 8lbs 7oz. Quite the sumo wrestler. Our daughter is quite enthusiastic about comforting him when he&#8217;s crying, and pointing out all his facial features.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m terribly sad. Literally, my heart hurts, and I&#8217;m sitting in my cube at work moved to the point of tears. On top of catching glimpses of photographs of abuse and hearing about the constant death toll, I&#8217;m now seeing reports about a video released by al Qeada showing the decapitation of a 26 year old American contractor. </p>
<p>Part of me wishes there was no such thing as today&#8217;s media and technology infrastructure where videos of atrocities can spread across the world in a matter of hours, but part of me appreciates that because of it, it might move people like me to do everything they can to avoid war.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of the argument about how much good we&#8217;re doing for the Iraqi people &#8211; that kind of &#8220;good&#8221; can be accomplished without war. People don&#8217;t need to be decapitated so that Iraqi children can go to elementary school. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><b>Summary:</b><br />
Day 1<br />
Brave attic. Traverse Vaulted Pass with 1&#215;3&#8242; gap. Ninja skills. Begin hole drilling in wall header. Battery dies half inch in. Try spinning drill bit by hand, quickly love hate drill for efficiency and lack of juice. Leave tools there. Ninja skills employed to get out of 1&#215;3&#8242; gap up Vaulted Pass. Splinters, shinners, awkward positions, fiberglass insulation avoidance, sweat, bleed, itch. Finish project another day.</p>
<p>Day 2<br />
Brave attic, still sore from last time. Traverse Vaulted Pass. Juggle battery, flashlight. Master 1&#215;3&#8242; gap. Total Ninja. Continue drilling. Consider giving up 1.5&quot; in. Pop through header at 2&quot;. Hole drilled. Peer in hole, discover 8 feet of insulation between you and outlet below. Totally bum out. Realize all efforts are futile.</p>
<p>Plan B:<br />
Poke wires through drywall ceiling. Plan to embed later, hide all blemishes. Take great pains to put wire in precise locations. Employ Ninja skills with added difficulty of pulling tools up super steep Vaulted Pass and narrow 1&#215;3&#8242; gap. Grunt, sweat, bump head on nail, splinters, shinners, awkward positions, cough, growl. Vow never to do that again.</p>
<p><b>Results:</b><br />
Rear surround speakers and wiring. Perfect.<br />
Front surround speakers and wiring. Total disaster &#8211; I missed the speaker locations by at least two feet. I was tricked by bizarre home construction. My office has a flat face to it, with the peak of the roof on the center of the office. In the attic, the rafters slope down, as if I have a sloped roof going down to the edge of the top of my office, complete with plywood indicating a roof. As it turns out, that totally threw me off, because where I thought the edge of my office was instead was where this fake roof intersected the ceiling of my office. It&#8217;s still a mystery to me why this fake roof exists, but now I have speaker wires in the wrong place and I&#8217;m never going back up there, ever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m in the market for an ergonomic chair, but I&#8217;m having trouble deciding what to get. I used to work in an <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,1592,a10-c440-p8,00.html">Aeron</a> chair, which was pretty nice, but I found myself getting jabbed by the seat&#8217;s framework a lot if I sat in totally unconventional ways.</p>
<p>I spent a few minutes sitting in both the Humanscale <a href="http://www.humanscale.com/products/freedom_headrest.cfm">Freedom Chair</a> as well as the Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,1592,a10-c440-p205,00.html">Mirra.</a> The freedom chair felt pretty good, though the headrest seemed a bit agressive when leaning back. The Mirra didn&#8217;t have enough forward lean for me, but felt better than the Aeron.</p>
<p>I just found out about the <a href="http://www.microsphere.com/m1openingpage.htm">Microsphere MT</a> which totally shakes things up for me. The idea of wrapping my displays around the chair is a different concept, one that I&#8217;m fully open to.</p>
<p>Basically, I need to be able to sit at a computer and write code, communicate by phone or video conferencing, and maintain my general consumption of online news and the blogosphere without feeling achy. I&#8217;m leaning towards the Freedom Chair, but wanted to broaden my options. Any ideas?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://www.opb.org/">local</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/"><span class="caps">NPR</span></a> station has been begging for donations lately for my entire half-hour drive to work, which itself is aggravating. Far more aggravating is having my normally intellectually stimulating radio programs replaced by smart people talking about the benefits of <span class="caps">NPR</span> with the sound of totally fake ringing phones with old school mechanical bells in the background. The aggravation is even further inflamed by the fact that each bell ring sounds different.</p>
<p>Seriously, who even has phones with clackity sounding bells anymore? What kind of call center searches for, and installs phones with different sounding bells, let alone bells at all? Those <span class="caps">NPR</span> geeks are scouring thrift stores and trendy retro shops spending their donation money on swanky retro phones, some of them probably pumpkin orange in color!</p>
<p>And this is where it all hits me like a brick in the head &#8211; I&#8217;m listening to an old folks station, where clackity bells actually mean something, and are dubbed in over the unsuspecting smart people talking intelligently about why donations to <span class="caps">NPR</span> are stupendous and soul saving. They&#8217;re there for the old people who love listening to flowers grow over the radio, and then love donating piles of money so that the sound of vigorous flower growth can be heard on the air.</p>
<p>So I sent them $5.00.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I brought up something at work that I&#8217;d heard a long time ago that I couldn&#8217;t verify was true or not. It goes likes this:</p>
<p>If on a regular work day around 11am in Manhattan everyone in every single building decided to step out of the buildings, would there be enough elbow room outdoors (including city streets and parks) for the lot?</p>
<p>We decided that Manhattan meant the Island of Manhattan (the cutoff being the Harlem River), not just downtown, and that elbow room meant about 2 square feet per person (which isn&#8217;t exactly elbow room, but easier on the maths). The consensus at work is that if we&#8217;re just talking residents then there&#8217;d be plenty of elbow room. At 11am, then there&#8217;d be a ton of people who commuted from outside of Manhattan.</p>
<p>So what do you think? <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil,</a> lover of New York, can you weigh in? <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> says it might be more true than false. <a href="http://www.civrot.org/home/">Vic</a> thinks no, but doesn&#8217;t trust his answer. <a href="http://www.photojunkie.ca/">Rannie</a> says there would not be room. <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/">Andre</a> says there would be room (I think he thinks everyone is as skinny as Uma Thurman). What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a pulled out of the garage this morning after carting the most garbage to the street for pickup ever, I saw a huge flock of geese making their way north in a sort of boomerang shape. I&#8217;ve always liked seeing the geese migrate one way or another in their haphazard way, constantly flapping their wings and honking incessantly. At night you can hear them coming from miles away, and without even having to see the flock you can determine where they are in the air by their racket.</p>
<p>As I began making my way northwest to work, I realized that this same flock of geese was headed in the same general direction as I was. While they could fly truly northwest, I was stuck to the roads, and followed my normal commute which is basically a bunch of farm roads that go west and north. I opened the sunroof despite the chilly morning so I could hear the glorious sounds of geese doing their glorious natural thing&#8212;migrating north for the summer.</p>
<p>The geese migrated with me as I commuted for my entire commute, going diagonal at a leisurely pace while I frantically tried to keep up in my zig zagging way. They changed positions in the sky relative to my position a few times, but for the majority of the drive I could see them from my sunroof or windows. Oh glorious nature.</p>
<p>Right as I was about to pull into work and bid farewell to the geese a bird of another fashion interrupted the oh so glorious moment of nature and sent geese swirling and flailing in its contrails, and probably dicing a few into bite sized cubes of geese. A Learjet literally flew right through the flock as it landed at the Hillsboro municipal airport adjacent to the tech neighborhood I work in. Despite the disruption, the geese reformed their wobbly boomerang shape and continued on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was thinking about monkeys today, and about how they&#8217;re always trying to beat on people. No one ever believes me when I say that monkeys had taken over a government building in India for weeks, but it&#8217;s 100% true. Except now I can&#8217;t find any of the original articles, and people think I&#8217;m a quack. But think of it logically. If you were in a gang of monkeys, you&#8217;d take over government buildings right and beat on people right? Of course you would! You&#8217;re a monkey!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other night I had a dream about a <a href="http://www.underwater.org/mermaid/botswana/images/ratel1-800.jpg">honey badger</a> preying upon an <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=incolor.inebraska.com/stuart/riders/anteater.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://incolor.inebraska.com/stuart/riders/shocker.htm&amp;h=262&amp;w=182&amp;sz=11&amp;tbnid=XCkKijtG22oJ:&amp;tbnh=106&amp;tbnw=74&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Danteater%26start%3D60%26hl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_en%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DN">anteater </a>in the middle of a freshly plowed field, tearing at the anteaters hind limbs, chasing it and chewing on it mercifulessly while Carrie and her sister were conducting a cordial conversation over a light picnic. To any casual observers of dreams, it should be immediately obvious that deep within the hidden channels of my conciousness I&#8217;m thinking I need a haircut. Again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.new-lifestyles.com/challenge.html">According to some health experts,</a> walking 10,000 steps in a day will burn from 2000 to 3500 calories a week (so, 70,000 steps in a week), which is what you need to be burning if you just want to be healthy. Ramp that up to 15,000 or more steps per day if you want to lose weight.</p>
<p>I ran the numbers, and if one step for me equals about three feet, then 10,000 steps in a day roughly equals walking 5.68 miles per day (5,280 feet (one mile) divided by 3ft (the length of my stride) comes to 1760 steps per mile). I did a rough guess of my current steps, and I think I walk about 0.23 miles per day (405 steps).</p>
<p>So, in order to increase my step allocation and therefore increase my already outstanding health, I&#8217;ve come up with a few ideas:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Reduce my steps to three inch increments. Doing so while maintaining normal walking speeds is required in order to not alarm others.</li><br />
<li>Circle things, like a 747 coming in for a landing. Keep arms out so as not to confuse others.</li><br />
<li>Walk to the printer instead of waiting for someone to get tired of seeing the printout to the point motivating them to walk around with it, asking who it belongs to.</li><br />
<li>Jog in place when talking to coworkers about their weekend. Keep upper body in normal office conversation positions (arm folder, gestures, resting hand on chin with finger covering lips to reflect interest).</li><br />
<li>Crabwalk to the door of the restroom (double points). Crabwalking to the actual toilet is extra credit. Offer to transfer documents and materials on stomach to insure others of your heightened sense of productivity.</li><br />
<li>Better anticipate the need of using the toilet, and walk instead of running. Running produces large strides, which are incompatible with the 10k steps per day program.</li><br />
<li>Push car to work. Help may be accepted, and also allows for opportunity to talk about the 10k step program. Letting others push the car for you as you stroll behind them is extra credit.</li><br />
<li>Perfom less handstands, and obviously, less hand walking. However, if the handstand is needed to transition into a reverse crabwalk, then by all means, handstand.</li><br />
<li>No skipping, trotting, gyrations, dancing, or any form of locomotion that decreases steps. Styles of walking that encourage more steps for distance travelled are of course encouraged.</li><br />
<li>Reduce levitation. Avoid hot air balloons, masses of helium filled balloons, yoga, psychic energy bouncing, ground effect air pressure trickery, or sorcery.</li><br />
<li>Walk to neighboring cube instead of calling or emailing. Crabwalking preferred. Scaling the cube wall with a mountain climbing rope might produce greater amounts of steps.</li><br />
<li>Take wheels off rollerskates. Skateboarding is exempt, but only if the point at which you begin rolling is the same point at which you stop.</li><br />
<li>Sleep with feet on the ground for any chance steps in your sleep.</li><br />
<li>Increase pacing. Pace in the shower. Avoid baths. While in the doctors office, pace in the waiting room, and at all times except for when the doctor tells you to hold still. Pace while waiting for the bus. Pace on the bus. When geographical constraints limit your area of possible pacing to a minimum, turn in circles.</li><br />
<li>And finally, to best increase the amount of steps you take, take up river dancing, and be terrible at it so as not to perform the obvious levitation tricks done by the professionals.</li>
</ul>
