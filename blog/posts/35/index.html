  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t mind paying taxes, but seriously, can it be any more complicated? I ran TurboTax (a horrible piece of software) three different times and got three different results, and now I live in fear of an audit. I am not a master of the black art of minimizing my tax obligations and I shouldn&#8217;t have to be.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t some politician try running for President who was touting a flat rate income tax? Who was that? Where is that guy, let me vote for him in futility. If the rule was simply: your tax obligation is exactly 16% of your income, think of how much simpler that would be. Forget about all the obscure credits, forget about dependants and withholdings and all that garbage. No paper work, no mutated frontal lobe <span class="caps">IRS</span> henchmen applying witchcraft to my tax return to see if I need a visit. Release those pasty accountants into the real world and let them get a tan so we don&#8217;t have to see the blue viens pulsing through their clear skin [I&#8217;m sure to be audited now].  Liberate! Simplify!</p>
<p>Take 16% of all my income before it hits my bank. Blur the line between &#8220;employee&#8221; and &#8220;consultant&#8221; and just call me &#8220;dude who accepts monetary compensation&#8221;. If you pay me for four hours of work, and give me no other benefits, tax me 16%. If you pay me to work for 50 hours a week with a group of other like minded individuals with a singular goal and give me health benefits and a free t-shirt, tax me 16%. If, as the leader of a publicly held organization, I report earnings of $2.6M in a quarter, tax it 16%, but not before I issue dividends to shareholders (who, by the very nature of the system, will be taxed 16% on the income from those dividends).</p>
<p>Throw out the idea of having to think of human beings as some sort of tax obligation &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t apply in the flat rate world. Worry only about collecting taxes on income, whether the income is collected by an individual or a corporation or a cow.</p>
<p>Throw away cash, and make it all electronic. If new money shows up in my account, take the 16%, but be smart enough to know when I&#8217;m just moving money so you don&#8217;t steal from me. Plant a <span class="caps">DNA</span> matched chip in my hand that authorizes payments for everything from toothpaste to tube socks with a Jedi-like wave, and charge me no sales tax (the man will pull out the 16% automatically before the remainder lands in the store&#8217;s account).</p>
<p>And make the entire thing impossible to abuse, game, hack, invade my privacy, and make me subject to an audit. And work a personalized key fob into somewhere too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I liked <a href="http://www.me3dia.com/">Andrew&#8217;s</a> opening to a <a href="http://www.me3dia.com/archive/001783.html#001783">blog entry</a> that said in effect &#8220;if I were blogging every day, it would be about the following&#8221; and so I&#8217;m doing the same thing.</p>
<p>For almost a month everything tasted like bananas. It started with a cold I got right after going to <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, and for over three weeks almost everything I ate had the distinct taste of bananas despite my distinct dislike for the taste of bananas. <a href="http://search.healthcentral.com/search.asp?query=banana+taste&amp;GO%21.x=14&amp;GO%21.y=10">Oddly, no medical documentation exists.</a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t get Tracy Chapman out of my head. I had some kind of vague dream where I was thinking about the recent sort of subtle boasting I&#8217;ve been doing about my new car, and she was in it singing &#8220;I drive a fast car&#8221;, and now that riff is stuck on repeat in my head. It&#8217;s punishment for subtle boasting. I really <i>do</i> want to boast about my car, but I know that&#8217;s so trashy, so I try to sneak it out. It&#8217;s like when you have a new haircut that actually looks good. You want to look int he mirror, but you know how vain that is, so you just &#8220;happen&#8221; upon reflections of yourself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using an old Palm IIIx lately, and I&#8217;m enjoying it. I have a wide and varied schedule at work and being able to carry that schedule around with me is very satisfying. And while it&#8217;s no elegant looking machine with WiFi or Bluetooth, it does the job, and is over five years old. But I&#8217;ll be honest here &#8211; it&#8217;s piqued my interest in owning and using a cutting edge <span class="caps">PDA</span>. Must resist. Must remember that, despite my current usage of the Palm IIIx, I will likely burn out on it at the end of one more week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298228/">Whale Rider</a> &#8211; looks like a hoaky Disney movie on the cover when it&#8217;s actually a good movie. Very impressed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had two incidents in the past few weeks where other Subaru <span class="caps">WRX</span> drivers have made a point to chat with me. I was getting a sandwich at Quizno&#8217;s a few weeks ago, and an Australian guy about my age came up to me and said &#8220;Nice choice in cars&#8221; (of course, cars sounded more like &#8220;caaaaahs&#8221; to my American ears). Turns out the <span class="caps">WRX</span> I parked next to was his, which was parked next to a Subaru <span class="caps">WRX</span> STi (the insanely overpowered version of my car). Driving home last night, a guy in a <span class="caps">WRX</span> wagon rolled down his window next to me at a stop light and discussed how he wished he&#8217;d waited for the 2004 models without the bug eye lights. The only time this has ever happened to me in the past is when I owned a Datsun 510, where almost weekly someone would comment on how much they loved Datsun 510s. Mine exploded. [Dang, I was going to link to <a href="http://www.mikecina.com/">Mike Cina&#8217;s</a> Datsun 510, but I can&#8217;t find it anywhere. He was the only person on the Internet who ever said &#8220;Hey man, I have a Datsun 510 too!&#8221;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a conversation with <a href="http://overstated.net">Cameron&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://overstated.net/04/04/13-choice-cubicism.asp">AI creation,</a> and it all came down to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:blue;">[18:03]</span> <span style="color:blue;"> cubicism</span>: It is imperative that that you know what you don&#8217;t know, but what you know, will not allow you to know what you don&#8217;t know.<br />
<span style="color:red;">[18:04]</span> <span style="color:red;"> elbow donkey</span>: I know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m as smart as the Time Cube. If it doesn&#8217;t make sense, it&#8217;s as Gene Ray states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:blue;">[18:00]</span> <span style="color:blue;"> cubicism</span>: You are a slave &#8211; to academic induced inculcated belief &#8211; an insidious entity, an evil which corrupts human mental ability to accept creation knowledge, as demonstrated in Cubicism.</p>
<p>That should clear it up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was putting my belt on this morning when I got to thinking. Do belt manufacturers conduct market studies that help them decide how many holes to put into a belt? Statistically, does a belt sized for a 32 inch waist grow by <i>x</i> amount of inches per quarter, and are belt buckle holes placed to maximize profits?</p>
<p>Of course, if I&#8217;m thinking about belts and profit margins, I can&#8217;t not think about something like my toothbrush. Now, I know toothbrush manufacturers are counting on that toothbrush to wear out. I&#8217;m sure Colgate has done extensive research on bristle stamina, how long competitors&#8217; toothbrushes last, and have come up with a scientifically derived Golden Mean of Toothbrush Longevity that, combined with things like Tornado Tips and Cross Action bristles maximizes profit.</p>
<p>So, turning back to the belt &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure belt manufactures think about these things. You can easily spend thirty bucks on the cheapest belt, and it might last you ten years if your waist line doesn&#8217;t change drastically. But imagine if belt manufacturers figured out that if they used cheaper material, and spaced their belt holes appropriately (based on Extreme Scientific Research), and priced them at about five bucks. They&#8217;d have a product with planned obscelence. And while they&#8217;d sell the product at a cheap price of five bucks, the next time around, &#8220;cheap&#8221; might be seven bucks because of inflation or because the cheap belt market heated up enough to allow expansions in profit margins. Heck, form a belt cartel, and start pumping out single hole belts for five bucks a pop. Surely you&#8217;ll sell more belts.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t stop at belts. Work the model into everything. Cars, computers, cell phones, digital cameras, lawn mowers, mechanical pencils, washing machines, rubber bands, computer software, music. Spend piles of money on figuring out how to make things decay so they keep running back to you over and over again. Make it easier to throw things away so that the initial cost is less, but over the long term, the cost is staggering. Hire me as your strategist and I&#8217;ll make you billions.</p>
<hr />

<p>I&#8217;m totally conflicted. While I&#8217;m building this whole &#8220;cheaper up front kills quality&#8221; rant, I&#8217;m realizing I think I prefer &#8220;cheaper up front&#8221;. I like products that work well, but I&#8217;m not sure I care if they last five years or twenty. If I had a car that lasted thirty years, I&#8217;m sure that ten years into it I&#8217;d be bored stiff by the car. I want to replace my old technology with new technology. If my toothbrush lasted ten years, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d lose it before I wore it out. I&#8217;d rather spend an incremental few bucks at a time then spend hundreds on something.</p>
<p>But then, I&#8217;m aware of the toll that &#8220;cheaper up front&#8221; has on everything. More waste, more pollution, higher long term costs, higher dependance on companies like Colgate that produce cheap, yet effective products.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, I don&#8217;t think I have much of a choice, especially when it comes to cars, computers, anything electronic, or tooth brushes. But where I do have a choice, I think I&#8217;ll start to prefer things like belts that last ten years but cost thirty bucks up front.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because I&#8217;ve been too busy to think of anything insightful or keen about the world I/we live in, I&#8217;m left with observations about myself and what annoys me. Nearly all of what annoys me takes place when I&#8217;m driving. Please take note:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of people driving wobbly and soft pedaled when talking on their cell phones. None of their driving characteristics exhibit explicit control over their hulking mass of an <span class="caps">SUV</span>. They simply look stupid.</p>
<p>American&#8217;s don&#8217;t understand round-abouts (traffic circles), and therefore, should be enrolled in a course. We have several circles in our little town and no one uses their turn signals. I&#8217;m going to make a sign that says &#8220;Use your turn signals, or hordes of you will shrivel up due to severe and rapid dehydration. Using your turn signals keeps the fresh water flowing to your house, among other life sustaining things, such as the photosynthesis. And yielding doesn&#8217;t mean stop when no cars are coming. When no cars are coming, haul some serious ass please.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the speed limit is 45 mph, please travel at least 45 mph. If you travel at 40 mph in a 45 mph zone and I&#8217;m stuck behind you, my insides turn inside out.</p>
<p>Stop trying to race me. If you have a Honda with a noisy muffler, an Acura, a Mustang, a Chevy S10 pickup truck, whatever, quit it. I have a fast car not so that I can prove something, but because I like to spend the least amount of travelling to and fro. And I will smoke you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have the ultimate pleasure of driving my new car on tiny farm roads to and from work in Oregon&#8217;s fantastic spring weather. As I was flying home tonight in the dusk, I came around a bend and saw a guy pedaling a bike. Having supremely keen eyes, I saw him from a mile away, but it occurred to me that he should really have had some kind of reflective strip on his back.</p>
<p>Then an idea hit me (or more like crawled out of the fog and startled me). It would be great if I could tell this guy that he should indeed have a stripe. But I couldn&#8217;t just pull over and chat it up, because that would break his stride, and he might even think I was being a nit picker. So it made sense to me that it would be great if I could just audibly say &#8220;Hey man, a reflective stripe might save you from getting flattened&#8221;, without slowing down, and have it show up as voicemail on his phone, or as a text message. He could have some device that allowed people to &#8220;page&#8221; him without interrupting his athletic endeavors and I could nit pick, anonymously.</p>
<p>I love the idea of social network devices, and the latter idea is one of those, in a way. I think it would be great (and totally scary) to be walking in Manhattan and to have a radar view of your friends, or people who you might be interested in meeting because they too liked popping bubblewrap. I anxiously anticipate the day.</p>
