<div class="entry-content"><p>I have two new friends, they are now named Fred and Ethel. They became my friends yesterday when I discovered the Joys of HalfpipeÂ©. I&#8217;d take pictures of these new contusions, but Carrie has the digital camera in Munich, and the webcam would reduce their beauty.<br />
I rode a true state-of-the-art halfpipe yesterday for the first time (I&#8217;d been on one that was practically made of cardboard before, when I was about 13) and I must say that now more than ever I want to figure out how to get a half-pipe in my garage. I did much better on this halfpipe than I thought I would. I can drop in without hesitation, do five-oh grinds, pump fakey or do frontside/backside turns. I&#8217;m quite pleased (and sore).<br />
I know I&#8217;ve been talking about skateboarding, almost excessively. It&#8217;s because onProject let me go, and skateboarding is my mind numbing drug of choice, not to mention, not having a job frees up some time for it. They hired me several months ago, and were really hoping I&#8217;d move out to New Jersey where they&#8217;re located. I seriously considered, to the point of almost packing everything up and moving out there, but family things came up, and it just wasn&#8217;t the right thing to do.<br />
They offered quite generously to let me telecommute from home, which I&#8217;m still grateful for. After a while though, it became obvious that for the kind of work I was doing was simply more difficult over an Internet connection. They were paying for an &#8220;expert&#8221; and only had someone writing code. I wasn&#8217;t able to offer guidance in the design of things as easily because I wasn&#8217;t there. My productivity was hampered by trying to work through technical issues that would have been fixed quicker (or not come up at all) had I been there.<br />
I think we all learned something valuable &#8211; telecommunting doesn&#8217;t always work. I&#8217;ve seen it work before, but this time it didn&#8217;t.<br />
I haven&#8217;t decided yet if I&#8217;m going to hunt down another job. I have a book to finish, and might be able to afford having the book as my full time job. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.<br />
Although, I&#8217;m still <b><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/resume.cfm">open for job offers</a></b>.</p>
