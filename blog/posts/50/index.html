It&#8217;s little things like this that get me thinking. If we go to war, protests aren&#8217;t going to be pretty, here have a flower type of events. You&#8217;re going to have the entire gamut of emotions and opinions, from those who are protesting or supporting the war&nbsp;peacefully, to those who are willing to be total stupid idiots (like the security guards and police in the story above). I think that because of the emotions tied up in this, it&#8217;s going to get real messy, with real idiots acting from both ends of the spectrum.</p><br />

Before I go I need to make sure I replace the single pair of jeans I was going to wear the whole time. I split them open at the knee skateboarding. I was chastised greatly by Carrie, rightly so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually doom a project into never never land by mentioning it here, but I&#8217;m beyond the point of no return, so I think I&#8217;m safe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been build some ColdFusion Components recently that do a couple of really cool things, and I&#8217;ve been thinking &#8220;Hey man, it would be cool to expose these components as web services so that people who don&#8217;t use ColdFusion could use the stuff I&#8217;ve written on their own site.&#8221; And so, I&#8217;m going to do some exposing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be converting the little snippet of code that I use to control the expiration dates thing on the right hand side of the site here. <a href="http://www.torrez.org" target="_self">Andre</a> <p>was a bit curious about it, and helped spawn the idea that it might be cool to allow others to use it too. I&#8217;ll change it so that instead of using a database, it uses an <span class="caps">XML</span> file which can sit on the server of whoever is consuming the logic that sits on my server.</p><br />
<p>But&nbsp;before that, what I&#8217;m going to make available is actually mostly of interest if you&#8217;re into ColdFusion, but it could be modified to work with any scripting language come to think of it. It&#8217;s a tool that generates ColdFusion&nbsp;code based off of a table structure. So, you say &#8220;Here are my tables and their data types, here are the primary and foreign keys, write me some code you filthy animal!&#8221; and off it goes and writes <span class="caps">INSERT</span>, <span class="caps">UPDATE</span>, <span class="caps">DELETE</span>, <span class="caps">SELECT</span>, <span class="caps">SELECT</span> with <span class="caps">INNER</span> JOINs (based on foreign keys). It writes forms to update and add new records to the database, as well as server side and/or Javascript validation. It knows when to create a select list, textareas, radio buttons, and text inputs. <strong>The works!</strong></p><br />
<p>Also, if you use ColdFusion 5.0 or below, and can&#8217;t consume web services, I&#8217;m building a form interface to it that can parse your table format information and spit out code that can be copied and pasted.</p><br />
<p>It all sounds ambitious, but seriously, the hard work has been finished. I just need an hour or two to put it up.</p><br />
<p>Speaking of web services, <a href="comments.cfm?id=421" target="">can you think of any other cool and simple tools I could make available</a>? I&#8217;m thinking that something that could go grab <span class="caps">RDF</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span> feeds and make them available in a bunch of different formats might be cool. Can&#8217;t parse <span class="caps">RDF</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>? How about getting it back in pure <span class="caps">HTML</span>? Might be handy.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was the worst thing ever. </p>
<p>First, the presenters, or lack of presenters. Dustin Hoffman opened the show, and I swear he was high on <span class="caps">PCP</span> or something. He stumbled on lines, tried to sing No Doubt&#8217;s &#8220;Hey Baby&#8221; song by saying &#8220;Say baby say baby, hey&#8221;. Then they had the performers presenting the next segment. It was so tense watching them fumble, and seemed so disorganized.</p>
<p>Then, the sound, and performances in general. The sound for the performances was so messed up. Vocal volumes were cranked up, drowning out drum beats and guitar sounds. When Simon and Garfunkle played, I couldn&#8217;t hear Paul at all. Art was overpowering him, which I&#8217;m sure suited Art just fine since Paul&#8217;s been hogging the spotlight for so long. When No Doubt played, I swear I couldn&#8217;t hear the drum beat or bass guitar. What is normally a quick and jumpy song sounded slow and washed out.</p>
<p>The show itself was a mass of confusion. People tripping on lines, camera changes and messed up shots. People getting confused as to which side of the stage to exit. Graphics showing on the screen for split seconds, requiring me to pause my TiVo to even see what they said. It was an utter foul up.</p>
<p>The only reason I watch the Grammys is to get an idea of what people think is popular these days. I&#8217;m not much of a pop music fan, I&#8217;m usually going for stuff thats less known&nbsp;to the mainstream, but popular in it&#8217;s own circles. Seeing performers like Avril what&#8217;s her name is lame, as if her style of music is cutting edge or something. I&#8217;ve seen countless punk bads, even as a kid, that used to churn out the same chorus-chorus-verse crap she puts out, but far better.</p>
<p>Watching the Grammys gives me further motivation to encourage people to put a little more effort into looking for good music outside of the mainstream. When you support local or independant music, your dollars are usually going directly to the artist, until they sign to a major label, at which point you start the cycle again.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t seek out good music, you get the 2003 Grammys. A filthy waste of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I have been having matching themes in our dreams, and we think it&#8217;s an omen. When she dreams of Al Qaeda rats, I dream of rats infesting the fridge. When she dreams of snakes eating meatloaf, I dream of living snakes as furniture design elements. We&#8217;re watching the same things on TV or reading the same news stories or something.</p>
<p>And now that I bring that I up, I should mention that I have little else to talk about because I&#8217;ve been working like a total freak at work, and most nights.</p>
<p>Which reminds me. Tomorrow is the second episode of the Survivor:Amazon season. As most people know, Carrie and I are quite literally obsessed with Survivor. We have been since season one. It&#8217;s unhealthy to enjoy it this much, and we don&#8217;t care. You&#8217;re required to love it too, because this time, it&#8217;s guys against girls. <a href="comments.cfm?id=417" target="">What do you think of Survivor?</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I could use either a PC or Mac to do my work without noticing. Both my PC Laptop and my iMac run the same tools and can access the same servers.</p>
<p>And that wouldn&#8217;t be a total lie if Dreamweaver on the Mac wasn&#8217;t a buggy turd. Everything seems to work just fine except for the following number one production killer: the shift key is buggy. So you like to use the shift key and arrows to select text. Well too bad monkey, no worky. Like to reverse-tab things with shift tab? You&#8217;re dreaming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People like me think that when you drop down into a deep voice and speak a little spanish in a slow rolling of the tongue way that it stokes the fire of love and passion. <strong>&iexcl;la pasi&oacute;n!</strong> <p>See how sexy that was? It&#8217;s Valentines day, which means I&#8217;m talking like that a lot today. I have an index card with all the right words to say to&nbsp;Carrie when I get home from work.</p><br />
<p>Five years ago I spent all day making the one and only true meal I ever succeeded at not making people sick with. Tortellini with Italian squash. It was splendid, a delight for the tongue, and I swear I was guided by angels to make it because that meal was to be special, and never to be made again. I bought one hundred tea light candles at Ikea, and one hundred tiny glass tealight candle holders, and placed them, unlit, around my apartment. I went to the wholesale flower warehouse behind my apartments, and bought perhaps three dozen tulips. I spread them throughout the apartment, and put the final touches on the meal. At exactly five minutes before Carrie was to get home, I ran frantically around the apartment lighting candles. That was a lot harder than I thought, but as I finished mere seconds before she came in.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ll let Carrie describe her reaction on her blog, but needless to say, she was floored.</p><br />
<p>I proposed to her that night. It was my plan from the start, and I knew that a stunning meal + candles + tulips = yes.</p><br />
<p>There&#8217;s no question that I should have asked her. Carrie is simply a wonderful person. I still scratch my head in astonishment, wondering how I could ever deserve her. She&#8217;s caring, funny, smart, and the most recent discovery &#8211; she&#8217;s an excellent mother. Her creative talents are immense to say the least, and she shares them with our precious daughter.</p><br />
<p>I had no doubts five years ago about whether it was the right thing to do, and I have no doubts about our future. I am truly blessed.</p></p>
