  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, in the middle of a vastly important span of time when deadlines were (and still are) quickly approaching, the office network ceased to function. Very quickly it became apparent that there wasn&#8217;t much one could do off the network that was very productive, but we had no idea whether the network would come back up any second. All of our well laid plans of development servers and source control and migrations came to a halt as something as simple as a router stopped routing. I spent some time thinking about this scary dependency, but stopped the second one of the English blokes suggested we eat lunch at the dry ski slope.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of this place (or a place like it) sometime before, probably on some local news time filler about the crazy Brits and their lack of real snow. I reasoned it was worth a look so I joined the party going there.</p>
<p>What you see is not what you expect. What I expected was a kind of Teflon grass, laying flat on the hill. Instead, it was a matrix of extremely dense tufts of one inch bristles sitting in a metal tray pointing straight up. The matrix was a diamond shaped grid, so the hill was perhaps only about 20% covered in bristles, although spread quite evenly. Every few diamonds a sunken water sprayer would spray out a fine mist, which was used to decrease the friction with boards or skis.</p>
<p>Charlie the Oracle guy and I decided to try it out, and within minutes I was strapping into a snowboard with my jeans and a T-shirt on in the middle of summer. Within seconds, I was admonished by a slope employee that I must wear long sleeves in case I fell. I could tell that falling would be completely unforgiving, and likely to break thumbs off due to the fact that for every square inch of bristle there were huge diamond shaped gaps of several square inches between and about an inch or two deep. Something would catch in a fall, and get snagged, be it an fist, thumb, elbow, ear, kneecap, you name it.</p>
<p>So rule number one: don&#8217;t fall. Rule number two took a bit of time to figure out. I&#8217;m used to snow, and it takes very little every, for me at least, to go slowly on snow with control (or fast for that matter). These bristles weren&#8217;t snow, and the moment after strapping in was crucial. Whenever I wasn&#8217;t moving quickly, I had barely any control. It wasn&#8217;t until I began to speed up that I felt comfortable.</p>
<p>It ended up that in order for me to get the bristles to feel the most like snow, I had to basically go has fast as humanly possible in a straight line down the steepest and longest run of 300 meters (with a few hundred feet drop). The run for me basically lasted about five seconds, and almost every time I don&#8217;t think made a single turn, but at least then I felt like I had the most control.</p>
<p>Overall, it was worth trying. I appreciate real snow, or even blown snow far more now. The effortlessness of turning will be something I will find very satisfying this next season. If I lived permanently in this part of England, it would be my only choice, and might even help accelerate my skills. It&#8217;s like some kung fu movie I saw where the teacher locked bricks to his students feet, and trained them as if they had no bricks. The second the bricks were removed, the students could kick holes through the Great Wall of China (promptly after turning evil kicking their teacher to pieces).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767908171/michaelbuffin-20/" target="">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a><p>&nbsp;by Bill Bryson and even though I&#8217;ve just started chapter three, I&#8217;m very much enthralled with it. Currently I&#8217;m exploring the cosmos, and the creation of the universe is simply stupifying to me, and mostly beyond my&nbsp;comprehension. How something so incredibly vast as the universe can have suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) come into existance is a serious mind bender.</p><br />
<p>Bryson is a&nbsp;good writer. He articulates some pretty complex points, writes with a good sense of humour, and without any sense of condescension. I left off last night reading about the scale of our current solar system. I can&#8217;t remember the exact facts, but something that struck me as amazing was that Pluto has only been seen a few times in the known history of man. It took seven years from the first sighting for an independant source to also spot it and verify it&#8217;s existance. It&#8217;s probably not helped that Pluto is very small by planet standards (it would fit in the lower 48 United States), has the color and reflectiveness of charcoal, and is so freaking far away. </p><br />
<p>Anyhow, Carrie got me the book, and I think she might be regretting it because my mind is filling up with trivia bits that I pester her with. She surpised me when getting it, and even kept it a secret. At one point we were travelling up a moving staircase in a tube station, and I made a remark when I saw a poster for it, suggesting that it looked like something I might like. She&#8217;s a good woman.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been torn a bit lately, and <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/blog/2003-06.htm#10011100" target="">I&#8217;m not the only one</a><p>. I&#8217;m trying to decide if I should maintain an entire technical blog on ColdFusion, or if I should use the current one, or if I should just forget the idea all together.</p><br />
<p>If I look at it one way, everyday I&#8217;m coming up with ColdFusion related technical solutions, and I haven&#8217;t been hot on talking about them. Mainly because I think people would get bored of reading it. I like to think that people come to my site to see if I&#8217;ve found a &#8216;possum living in the back of my pick up truck (it happened once, not sure if I wrote about it, and can&#8217;t tell because the search is broken on my site (because I&#8217;m lazy)) or to see what new and exotic locale I&#8217;ve dragged my family to.</p><br />
<p>But when I get to thinking like that, I say &#8220;Hey, who&#8217;s this site for? You, or them?&#8221;. The answer isn&#8217;t black and white, but a shade of gray. About 80% of me says its for me. I enjoy stepping back and seeing what I wrote a few years ago, and I enjoy just doing writing stuff in general. But at the same time, I enjoy thinking that others find my stories interesting or funny, and I don&#8217;t want to lose that.</p><br />
<p>And then I think about myself, and the likelihood that I could keep another site up to date. It&#8217;s not impossible, but I have a high degree of confidence that I&#8217;d get a single entry up, and that would be it, and then I&#8217;d feel like a big fat jerk. Much like I feel about most of the projects I start and never finish.</p><br />
<p>But then, never writing about ColdFusion isn&#8217;t helpful either. I miss out on cataloging solutions I might benefit from in the future. Having ColdFusion solutions on my site helps new visitors (or existing ones who check out my heavily content laden ColdFusion section) with problems. Everyone gains. I think that as long as I don&#8217;t decrease the amount of &#8220;look at this stupid thing I did&#8221; stories, adding ColdFusion entries isn&#8217;t such a big deal.</p><br />
<p>So, I&#8217;m going to give a go at sneaking in some technical content now and then, and see how it goes. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be able to call the expirement a success or not. We&#8217;ll just see what happens.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve done some pretty disgusting things in my life, but on Friday, I topped them all.</p>
<p>The dishwasher in our place in England doesn&#8217;t seem to do a very good job. You spend about as much time prewashing the dishes as you would just washing them, that&#8217;s how untrustworthy it is. So I got to thinking on Friday that perhaps it needed softer water, which meant adding salt to a receptable in the device. I fished out the user manual, realized that it needed no salt, but that cleaning the filters was a good idea.</p>
<p>I pulled the first filter out and was presented with what I can only call a fantastic microcosm of biology. Was it a mold?&nbsp;A lichen? Perhaps an ancient large form of bacteria, impervious to things like hot magma from the earth&#8217;s core or septic systems. What I knew for sure was that it was green, sticky, and reaked of evil.</p>
<p>I spent about a half hour cleaning the first filter, and it was disgusting. The dishwasher is some fine piece of German engineering, and the filter itself was designed to stop some of the bigger pieces of stuff from flowing past. Because of this, it had some elaborate trap system, and had millions of nooks and crannies to clean.</p>
<p>The second filter was a finer sort of&nbsp;filter, made from a mesh of metal this time, and it too was coated in green sludge. I cleaned off the sludge, then realized that the mesh was clogged with what looked like limescale or detergent build up. It was invincible to my scrub sponge, and required some heavy duty scraping from a spoon. It was hard, satisfying work, knowing that this scale probably reduced the water flow through the mesh to nearly nothing.</p>
<p>The third and final filter was an even finer mesh, and took the same kind of treatment as the rest.</p>
<p>I have yet to run the dishwasher, but I&#8217;m convinced it will work like a champ now. And even though the dishwasher has a nice clean filter, the stress relief cleaning it provided was great. I was able to apply physical efforts towards solving some kind of problem, which is something I never get to do at work. I spend my entire day thinking, and then applying some of that thought in the form of code. Having a tangible work product is very satisfying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think I have an interesting, perhaps clinical problem. It&#8217;s hard to make of what it is or why it is, but it certainly is. I&#8217;m becoming unmovable, unemotional. Something is deadening my senses, and I&#8217;m not sure what.</p>
<p>With one exception though: Leah is simply amazing to watch as she grows and devours the world. Her senses are on fire. You can almost hear the nueral networks building in her head. Perhaps watching her makes me realize how slow I learn things. She&#8217;s on the extreme end of things, and I&#8217;m not there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking that this whole &#8220;I can travel to and work from anywhere thing&#8221; has really taken a toll on me. I feel physically and mentally exhausted, and it&#8217;s not just the project, it&#8217;s everything about simply living in a place that is not officially home. I can almost feel empathetic about rocks stars who are constantly away from home and on tour.</p>
<p>A big change is in order, which is scary to suggest because that&#8217;s all my life has been in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Or maybe I could just use some downtime, sunning myself on a beach, watching Leah devour her world.</p>
