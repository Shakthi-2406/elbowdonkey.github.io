  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=penultimate" target="">penultimate</a> <p>goal in life is to become as powerful as Lex Luther. Indeed, he&#8217;s a fictional character, which works out in my favor, because if he were real, I&#8217;d have a competitor.</p><br />
<p>One step towards Lex Luther status, in my opinion and master plan, is to harness the power of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and blog syndication. I can now, after a carefully pressed sequence of buttons and mouse clicks, display an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed on my <a href="links.cfm" target="">links</a> page. I know, I know, this can be done with other tools, and I myself was even doing it, but I assure you, my tool&nbsp;is&nbsp;now&nbsp;213% more powerful. In the background, every time I consume an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed, I also raise the temperature of the Indian Ocean by 0.00003453%. Let&#8217;s see your <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader do that.&nbsp;Certainly, only someone with Lex Luther Like Intentions as myself would consider creating and calling upon a&nbsp;raiseOceanTemperature(&#8220;Indian Ocean&#8221;) algorythym. And does your <span class="caps">RSS</span>&nbsp;reader slice rain forest monkeys in half with a wink? I think not. Only I would create a divideRainForestMonkeysEvenlyAndAccurately() class.</p><br />
<p>Also, my dream of monitoring 10,000 <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds is far closer than can be comprehended even by&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computing.vt.edu/research_computing/terascale/" target="">third fastest supercomputer&nbsp;</a>. I built a robot. I call this robot HK9001. HK9001 now knows about 6,000 <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds, and visits these feeds on a regular basis. HK9001 also discovers new feeds, both through current feeds, and through feed authorities. Anyone with Lex Luther Like Intentions such as myself should find it fully obvious the power of HK9001. Knowing what every blogger ate for lunch will aid in my partnership with McDonalds and Pepsi. And HK9002 can only be more powerful. Already, HK9002 is being designed to evaporate red headed children using precision mirrors and sonic waves. One can only imagine the clutch HK9002 will have over the estimated 2 billion read headed children.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been studying <a href="http://joi.ito.com" target="">Joi Ito</a> <p>for some time now. I read his blog, I participate in his <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel. I read <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/sgodin.html" target="">articles</a> about him. I&#8217;m a boarderline stalker. I know he&#8217;s politically opposed to eating whale, yet he recently tried <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/sgodin.html" target="">whale kidney</a>. I know that before he even showers that he&#8217;s in his chat channel to see what&#8217;s happening throughout the world. And I know that he likes to sneak disco <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/sgodin.html" target="">dancing</a> behind his friends &#8211; a prankster at heart.</p><br />
<p>I started studying Joi first through his weblog. I ran across it somehow, and enjoyed the peek into Japanese culture. I began to find out that Joi&#8217;s been involved with some pretty interesting projects, including Japan&#8217;s Infoseek, and more recently, TypePad. </p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ve really started to enjoy the way Joi does things. I&#8217;m very much the entreprenuel type, and have spent a good amount of time assessing the personalities of those who have made a success at being entreprenuel. There are true alpha personalities, snakes,&nbsp;people with a lot of luck, lazy but smart people, criminals, and then there are guys like Joi &#8211; nice guys.&nbsp;Among the nice guys, I think Joi is unique because he has an extra layer of humility.</p><br />
<p>To me, it seems Joi is looking to attribute his successes to&nbsp;those around him. He always seems to lift and support those who come in contact with him, and he&#8217;s quick to point out the talents of everyone. He&#8217;s a regular guy in most regards, except he&#8217;s exceptional at being humble. Combine that pure&nbsp;humility with a sharp business sense, and you have someone who&#8217;s network of friends is willing to see him be as successful as he&#8217;s been, and hopes he continues.</p><br />
<p>Joi is the type of investor and business builder I&#8217;d like to be, and I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s around to be a good example. I&#8217;m firmly convinced that Joi will help shape the Internet to come, but it won&#8217;t be so much of Joi coming up with the ideas as it will be Joi lifting up and supporting those who have something clever and useful to give.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It snowed this weekend, the very weekend we were moving into our new house.&nbsp;But don&#8217;t think&nbsp;we were trudging through four feet of snow carrying boxes with icicles hanging off their corners, our breath freezing into&nbsp;crystaline mists that crash into microscopic symphonies&nbsp;with every step.</p>
<p>We took a load over in the pickup&nbsp;on Friday night to the new house, then spent the evening walking among the riot of the walking dead in the dry cold. The ghosts, the goblins, the sumo wrestlers and fairy princesses. Leah understood the concept of Halloween immediately, and set out with an intensity unmatched by any of the other kids crowding the streets. She was experiencing something completely new and exciting and loving it, dressed as a big hairy lion. She looked like a two foot tall Tina Turner. In the near freezing cold she lasted longer than we did, but we let her drag us around anyways.</p>
<p>On Saturday we were done moving before a single flake fell. It was cold, but the cold was a welcome alternative to sweating as we transfered our storage unit to a fifteen foot yellow box with wheels and a gas pedal to a three car garage. We scraped together the remainder of our apartment, realizing that, as usual, the last items are always the hardest to pack. We balanced seven foot leather sofas over our heads down three flights of stairs, cursing their existence with every downward step -&nbsp;praising their existing as we crashed into them at the end of our move Saturday night.</p>
<p>On Sunday we rested. The warmth and comfort of our home stood out in stark contrast to the rain and snow outside. We nursed our muscles and walked stiffly, avoiding the stairs as Leah tore circles around every open space, more excited than she&#8217;s ever been. She knows more than we do that this is our home now.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Carrie and I have lived in four apartments, one condiminium, in parents&#8217; homes, and a little brick house in England, not to mention countless hotels. Words cannot describe the peace and comfort that a new, solid, permanent, and warm home provide. We&#8217;re truly looking forwarding to spending as much time here as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I were in the checkout line the other night, and the headline on the Weekly World News said &#8220;Osama and Sadam adopt shaved ape baby&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shaved ape baby? That has to be the funniest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard. I want a subscription. And why do they need to adopt? And since when were they together? And why shave an ape? If that&#8217;s not chicken soup for the soul, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly building up a <a href="http://mx.blogs.com/photos/skate/" target="">skateboarding photography</a> <p>album. I&#8217;ll probably add a few today -&nbsp;had a good session shooting at Department of Skateboarding in Portland. I&#8217;ve learned that cheap equipment (like a ten dollar optical slave driver) fail in the times of need. Although, last night I learned that the SB-80DX flash can take sequences. I was taking about three frames per second with full flash. That&#8217;s fantastic.</p><br />
<p>Leah spoke her first sentence last night. She even used it in context.&nbsp; I handed her a crayon, and she was very polite, and said &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; At this rate, she&#8217;ll have full command of the English language by the age of 2. Several weeks ago she was at about 37 words &#8211; now, I&#8217;m sure it would be nearly 100 or more. The rate it which babies progress is astounding.</p><br />
<p>And did I mention <a href="http://www.toottoot.org" target="">Otto</a>? I did, but I didn&#8217;t mention that it&#8217;s actually me. Inspired by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380973545/michaelbuffin-20" target="">Letters from a Nut</a> years ago, I decided that it was my calling in life to entertain those who answered letters, and those who read them afterwards. I have a letter from Pantene right now that&#8217;s pure gold, but I&#8217;m too busy to put it up. This is the last I will mention my affiliation with Otto however. I&#8217;m hoping to develop his character a little further, make him more believable.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having family members shot and killed by deranged teenagers is a terrible thing. Blaming the deaths of your family members on a video game, then <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/10/22/videogame.lawsuit.ap/index.html" target="">suing the designers of the video game</a> <p>for $246 million is unbelievable.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m tired of people trying to link video games to violent crimes. Lack of strong parental guidance and the lack of advocating personal responsibility have far greater blame than a mere video game. Kevin Durkin and Bonnie Barber <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W52-4712F4N-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_handle=W-WA-A-A-D-MsSAYVW-UUA-AUZZYYZBDD-CBCUUADD-D-U&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2002&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%236558%232002%23999769995%23367527!&amp;_cdi=6558" target="">published</a> evidence that suggest the complete opposite of&nbsp;what the media supposes&nbsp;- that video games actually produce a positive outcome in teenagers who play them.</p><br />
<p>A <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:oSQXK2hnHpgJ:www.doh.wa.gov/cfh/Videoresearch.doc+Video+Games+and+Real-Life+Aggression&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="">study</a> conducted by the Washington State Health Department had mixed results, but found that for the most part, that teens who were considered delinquent or violent preferred non-violent video games, and good teens preferred the violent ones.</p><br />
<p>There are literally countless numbers of publications that strongly suggest that there is absolutely no correlation between real life violence among teens who play violent video games.</p><br />
<p>I truly do feel sorry for the families involved here, but blaming video games is never going to work. It&#8217;s an easier target to blame than broken families, families where both parents work, parents who are poor examples of model citizens, abusive families, drug abuse among families, families where the needs of the children are eclipsed by the wants and desires of the parents.</p></p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m usually <strong>always</strong> <p>amazed at where I show up in Google rankings for certain keywords. More often then not, people searching for extremely bizarre things end up here, and I get a real kick at looking at my server&#8217;s log files for Google hits.</p><br />
<p>A while back, I figured out a way to isolate just the Google hits into a log file, and when I recently rebuilt my webserver, completely lost that trick. I will document it here so I never forget again.</p><br />
<p>First off, I only know how to do this in Apache 1.0 and up. If you&#8217;re using <span class="caps">IIS</span>, you might be out of luck (all the more reason to switch to Apache).</p><br />
<p>In your httpd.conf file, add the following somewhere:</p><br />
<p><code>LogFormat &#8220;%{Referer}i -&gt; %U&#8221; google_searches</code></p><br />
<p>Keen eyes might notice that this is the exact same format for tracking referers. I&#8217;ve split the two in case I ever want to format the log differently in the future.</p><br />
<p>Within a Virtualhost, add the following (it might be different for you, but I host multiple domains on a single IP, so VirtualHost is the way to go for me):</p><br />
<p><code>SetEnvIfNoCase Referer google google_ref<br />CustomLog &#8220;|/usr/local/sbin/cronolog /logs/michaelbuffington/google/%Y%m%d.log&#8221; google_search env=google_ref</code></p><br />
<p>The SetEnvIfNoCase directive, in plain English says &#8220;If, within the Referer field you see the word google, throw everything you know about that particular hit into a variable called google_ref.&#8221; Keep in mind, the word &#8220;google&#8221; in this case is a regular expression (a very simple one). It will match any bit of text with the word google in it, include bogoogle (something Australians do), or pugoogleck (an Eskimo word for &#8220;punch in the eye&#8221;). I might accidently track incoming users that aren&#8217;t coming from Google. That&#8217;s interesting to me too, so I don&#8217;t mind so much.</p><br />
<p>Then, I get tricky. The CustomLog directive commands Apache to normally just write a log file to a particular location in a particular format (the format being the one I specified in LogFormat earlier, google_search). But in my case, I&#8217;m doing a bit more here. I use a program called cronolog that splits my log files up into seperate files. I&#8217;ve set it up to split them up by day. This works well for me, but it can be totally changed depending on your needs.</p><br />
<p>I do almost the same thing to my Refers log file as well, except I simply exclude blank referers, as well as referers coming to from my own site. I&#8217;m am, if you haven&#8217;t gathered, fond of outside attention, so I have new referers streamed to my wristwatch using satellites, lasers, and nanotechnology.</p><br />
<p>I hope that you too will be able to take advantage of this, but don&#8217;t give me credit, that belongs to Apache. You may, however give me cash.</p><br />
<p><!--StartFragment --><strong>Update:</strong><br />I created a page that shows the <a href="google.cfm" target="">live Google stats</a>. Hopefully this serves to produce even stranger Google searches, as Google does weird ranking stuff if you list your Google stats I&#8217;ve heard.</p><br />
<p>Also, I changed the pattern of google to &nbsp;([.]<ins>)google([.]</ins>) which looks really funny if you don&#8217;t get the concept of regular expressions. It basically says &quot;match any bit of text that has one or more full stop (the [.]+ part) followed by the word google, followed by one or more full stop again. I probably don&#8217;t need parens around [.]+, but then again, I don&#8217;t really need to wear socks, they&#8217;re just more comfortable. With this fancy new pattern, I should get a lot more actual Google matches. I fixed this because the Live Google Stats page was showing up in the stats, which, as you might appreciate, is a bad thing. </p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="">iTunes</a> <p>on my Mac mostly to listen to Internet radio. I know there are programs that do the same thing, but I&#8217;ve never taken the time to get into them, so iTunes filled the need perfectly. I&#8217;m aware of the Music Store and all of it&#8217;s MP3 organizational powers too, but haven&#8217;t got into them.</p><br />
<p>I wanted&nbsp;to listen to Internet radio&nbsp;at work, where I use a PC, and was pretty happy when Apple released iTunes for Windows. I&#8217;m amazed at how badly the install went, and couldn&#8217;t be more displeased with Apple for it. Apple didn&#8217;t help things by&nbsp;claiming that it&#8217;s &#8220;The best Windows app ever&#8221;. My already high expectations set iTunes up for some serious chances for things to go wrong.</p><br />
<p>For one, the install crashed twice when I tried to install it. I had made sure all other applications were closed, giving it the best chances possible to install. Eventually, I rebooted my machine thinking that maybe the memory was a bit dirty from having been used for possibly a week without a reboot.</p><br />
<p>After the reboot, the install worked. Fair enough &#8211; it might have been a problem with my computer, but I won&#8217;t let Apple off the hook for that. There are plenty of software packages that I&#8217;ve installed that have had no problems, ever. Small, one man shops using free installers often have easier times making it onto my computer than iTunes did. Apple should produce much more robust software.</p><br />
<p>I fired up iTunes, went straight to the Radio tab, and was quickly prompted with an error message. Couldn&#8217;t connect to the Internet. It should have actually told me that it couldn&#8217;t detect my proxy settings, which is what the real problem was. You see, it does a kooky thing. It looks for Internet Explorer&#8217;s current proxy/connection settings, rather than store them in the application itself, and if it finds anything amiss, it just tells you that the Internet is broken, even as you&#8217;re searching Apple&#8217;s website looking for an answer to the problem. I think this is a poor shortcut to take&nbsp;- I want control over how iTunes connects to the Internet. I don&#8217;t want it piggybacking some other application that I rarely use anyhow. In anycase, it doesn&#8217;t even work.</p><br />
<p>I use an automatic proxy settings script, and for whatever reason, iTunes could use it, so it gave up. The only way to make iTunes work behind my proxy was to hard code the values into Internet Explorer, bypassing any automatic proxy settings scripts. Obviously, if the entity that handles the proxy server changes something, I will have to go back and &#8220;fix&#8221; it for iTunes to work.</p><br />
<p>Once all this has been sorted out, iTunes works exactly the same as the OS X version. The thing is, I&#8217;m feeling very much let down by Apple. Here they are, parading &#8220;The best Windows app ever&#8221;, and they&#8217;re blowing it by having a crappy install. I find it highly unacceptable.</p></p>

<p>This reminds of something that was happening to me while in the UK. The Xerox offices in Bourne End we&#8217;re very open &#8211; no cube walls, all desks connected. I really enjoyed the social aspect of it, and ended up getting more done when I was surrounded by people. It had one interesting side effect though:</p><br />
<p>If I was deep into writing code and someone came up to talk to me, while turning my attention to them, and listening to what they had to say, I&#8217;d often try to complete the &#8220;thought&#8221; I was writing. Often what came off the tips of my fingers was fascinating. It would usually be code, but the code would usually be nearly completely random snippets of bigger pieces that I&#8217;d recently written, or just total jumbles of code that had no place being there.</p><br />
<p>Over time I&#8217;ve noticed that I often am able to write complex code without exactly thinking about syntanx or anything. It just flows out as easy as chatting with someone or writing up an email, or even walking.</p><br />
<p>After watching a recent Scientific American show with Alan Alda, I&#8217;m convinced that when we continously repeat similar tasks, that the part of our brain that processes that task moves from the more sentient, &#8220;human&#8221; part of our brain to the more primitive, auto-pilot part of our brain. The frontal lobes handle new experiences, and new problem solving, and essentially train some of the rear lobes to do the task.</p><br />
<p>Tests on toddlers on this same show illustrated this very clearly. Toddlers were tasked to sort cards with&nbsp;red&nbsp;stars and cards&nbsp;with blue stars into one pile, and cards with red trucks&nbsp;and cards with blue trucks into another pile. When the rules were changed, and the toddler was asked to sort by color only (all red cards in one pile, etc), they failed over and&nbsp;over again. They had a very difficult time untraining themselves from the first task.</p><br />
<p>Toddlers&#8217; frontal lobes are far less developed than adults. As I watch my daughter learn and grow,&nbsp; its quite obvious that her problem solving skills are just now merely emerging. I can get her to make the same mistakes when she&#8217;s playing with her shape sorting toy as the toddlers in the show. She can put five circles into the toy, but the second you give her a square, she goes straight to the circle hole (even though she&#8217;s been able to get the square shape into the square hole before). Show her how to put the square into the square hole, and she will keep going for the circle hole. However, given enough successes with the square shape into the square hole, and she&#8217;ll become an expert again, failing the second you give her a circle. As her brain develops, she&#8217;ll begin to further understand the role that the individual shapes play in this exercise, but for now, her instruction set is simple: this object goes in this hole, repeat.</p><br />
<p>It makes sense that our brain behaves like this. It&#8217;s like our brains are executing common functions in a less &#8220;<span class="caps">CPU</span>&#8221; intensive area of our brain (the rear lobes). A part of our brain optimized for repetition. The code is written in the less primative part of the brain (frontal lobes)&nbsp;optimized for problem solving, the part of the brain that memorizes the instruction set and prepares it for the repetitive part of our brain.</p><br />
<p>If our brains didn&#8217;t do this, we&#8217;d basically be monkeys. If we only had the repetitive part of our brain, we&#8217;d have little room for problem solving.&nbsp; If we didn&#8217;t have the repetitive part of our brain, we&#8217;d be overgrown newborn babies, having to address every problem as a new problem. Granted, there are other parts of our brain that handle basic motor skills, body functions, etc, but the parts of us that are essentially human would be overworked.</p><br />
<p>On a energy conservation level, it makes sense to spend some effort solving something, then hand it off to a less intense part of the brain. Our bodies are machines built to be as effective at conserving energy as possible. Using just the problem solving part of our brain to function would be like trying to use the first gear in a transmission to get up to top speed. It might be possible, but in the process it would burn a lot of energy, and put the entire system at risk for failure because of the stress.</p><br />
<p>The human brain is simply amazing. Yet, with billions of human brains roaming the planet, we still haven&#8217;t figured out how to make a good pair of nanopants, with built in, gravity and motion aware Insta Seat Deployment. That sucks!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I was sitting at my desk at work, and I was suddenly overcome with this intense humiliation for not having two monitors. I looked at my one monitor, turned red in the face, and thought to myself &#8220;I can do better than this, surely, I can&#8221;. So I got up and left work. Right in the middle of what I was doing, which, at the time, was stewing about having no monitor like I was saying.</p>
<p>I had a monitor and video card just sitting in my storage unit, collecting dust, and so I went out and got both of them. I brought them back, heaving my Sony Trinitron display into the building (I swear, if it&#8217;s not 200 lbs it&#8217;s at least 100). I spent a good amount of time heaving and huffing and puffing and arranging things, then I popped open the case of my computer, dropped in the card, and booted up. Everything worked just fine. There was a brief moment of panic when I thought that I&#8217;d put the left monitor on the right side, and the right one on the left. This was easily fixed in Windows 2000 by dragging the display icon from left to right in the display properties.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m loving the dual monitor setup. I have my email and Trillian windows up in the right monitor (it&#8217;s a bit smaller, lower resolution too) and all my &#8220;Primary Objectives&#8221; stuff up in the left, bigger monitor. The increased radiation is also doubling the rate of my tan, which wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d considered when taking on this mini project.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going double double!</p>
