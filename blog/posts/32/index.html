  <div class="entry-content"><p>We figured out that we could have water, just not hot water, while waiting for the plumber. I&#8217;m literally boiling a vat of water right now so that I can take a bath in what I&#8217;m hoping will be warm water. I would have easily* braved the cold shower, except out faucets seem to require some pressure on the hot water side.</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;Easily&#8221; being used loosely of course. I&#8217;m certain I would have shrieked like a little girl being chased by mountain lions the moment I dipped my toe in.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Update:</b><br />
A boiling vat of hot water does nothing to raise the temperature of a bath tub. It only adds insult to the entirely uncomfortable situation of freezing to your inner core.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During lunch today I took my daughter along to run some errands, and here are some highlights:</p>
<p>While driving through farm land to the bank I rolled down her window so she could see some horses. As the window was rolling down, she placed her hand on the edge and said &#8220;See! I push it down! Look, horses. Sheep! Wind in kitty&#8217;s hair!&#8221; as she hung her toy cat out the window.</p>
<p>When depositing a check at the <span class="caps">ATM</span>, I could hear her in the truck saying &#8220;There it goes. Put it in.&#8221; as the deposit envelope was swallowed up.</p>
<p>Then it was time to hit Fry&#8217;s. I figured out that I&#8217;ve been totally missing out on the good audio on my home entertainment system because I&#8217;m not user a fiber optic audio cable. In the process of looking for that we played with  a Robosapien robot, which Leah was cautious about. When she first saw it, she ran up to it and said &#8220;Robot! See! Daddy, uhhummuhh* play with robot?&#8221;. She tested each Leap Frog toy, and determined that the one she currently owns, Baby Tad, was the best.</p>
<p>We then went to Costco for milk and laundry detergent. She nearly insisted I buy a Futurama <span class="caps">DVD</span>, which I nearly agreed with, but luckily the 2005 Curious George Calendar intervened. We sat and ate pizza, and she flirted with someone from Xerox sitting next to us.</p>
<p>On the way home we listened to one of her CDs. I ended up putting it on repeat so she could hear her favorite song over and over.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is her &#8220;fill the gap&#8221; sound. This is how she makes her speech sound more mature, by filling it in with a bunch of nonsense between the key, and most important words.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I walked into a downtown Portland skateshop this Saturday with the intent to buy some new shoes. On a single pillar display in the shop were about four pairs of Vans, with no other shoes in sight. The guy behind the counter was in the trance of a skate video on an overhead monitor, and uttered the most profound stupidity I&#8217;ve ever heard in response to &#8220;Are these your only shoes?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, we only carry functional shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t carry Etnies, or eS, or anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re into, you know, what works. If you want fashionable shoes, you can go over to this place a few blocks that way called The Outdoor Store.&#8221;</p>
<p>I smelled a rat instantly. This guy was feeding me a line of crap. The true story was more than likely that because The Outdoor Store had a relationship with a major distributor of skateboard goods, this little shop wasn&#8217;t able to get anything but the cheapest and most short lived shoe in the business, shoes that last about a month with regular skating &#8211; Vans. Distributors are super picky about keeping their goods in a single, tried and true shop. So I bit back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so that&#8217;s why you only have Vans. You&#8217;re in the shadow of The Outdoor Store when it comes to being able to get product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man, we just stick to functional shoes. We don&#8217;t do all the fashionable, latest trend shoes. The shoes work. They might not have all the latest gizmos and bullsh*t, but they stay on your feet.&#8221; (getting a bit worked up)</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even Kostens? I&#8217;ve been wearing Kostens for years now. They&#8217;re one of, if not the most popular skate shoe ever, and have been super functional every time I&#8217;ve purchased them. There&#8217;s no gizmos or anything. These have lasted a year, with me skating on them nearly every other day&#8221; as I lifted my foot up so he could.</p>
<p>With that, he was silent. He lost me forever that morning. It&#8217;s one thing to be honest and say &#8220;man, distributors are hard on us, maybe we can special order or something&#8221;, but it&#8217;s another to lie and insult someone standing in your store with a fist full of cash, ready to give you the high profit margins you desperately need to maintain a downtown, first floor store front.</p>
<p>I met back up with my Mom who was at Saturday Market, and we walked back to the car. On the way there, we saw The Outdoor Store, and went inside. It turns out I have yet another reason to never set foot in Cal Skate again &#8211; the only footwear The Outdoor Store sells are cowboy boots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here I am, happily writing code when I&#8217;m struck with one of the crazier bugs I&#8217;ve see in a program. I can reproduce it every time, and if you have Dreamweaver MX, I&#8217;d be curious to see if you can also reproduce it.</p>
<p>So, to make it happen &#8211; create a new file, type a bunch of garbage for a few lines, and then type the word InstanceEndEditable and notice that not only can you not type a single thing after that word, but you can&#8217;t get rid of the word itself. Also, you can modify the file all you want up until that word, but after that word is in your file, consider yourself an ant trying to push over a tree.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b><br />
So curiosity got the better of my productivity and so I did some poking around. From what I can tell (without reading any docs) is that this keyword, along with a group of others, is used when creating Dreamweaver MX Templates. Unfortunately non-Dreamweaver MX templates seem to obey the keywords as well.</p>
<p>Why do I need to use the keyword in first place? I&#8217;m parsing the <span class="caps">HTML</span> source of a website that generates random word lists for wordPhoto.org, and was using that keyword from within their source to say &#8220;generally speaking, the word list ends here.&#8221; Guess I&#8217;ll have to pick something else from their source.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe this is old hat for some, but it just occurred to me that those who profit off of providing email related services, whether those services are email server software, spam filters, firewalls, etc, have very little incentive to improve email.</p>
<p>If selling email server software were my sole business right now I&#8217;d quickly be out of business. There are plenty of good and free email servers out there. But if I could roll in a bunch of spam fighting features, I might be able to compete in the crowded market. Have the best spam fighting features, and then I start looking desirable.</p>
<p>Almost any email related business seems to benefit from spam, including the spammers. In fact, big web email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail also need spam to compete. If suddenly everyone agreed on a standard, spam proof fix to the email portion of the Internet, there&#8217;d quickly be little to differentiate one email provider from another. Spam is so hard to fight, that the features big email providers toss into the mix are likely to be forever evolving as the techniques for getting spam into our inboxes evolves, making the provider with the current, most comprehensive anti-spam tools the winner.</p>
<p>If you could fix, and make spam impossible to send or receive, all you&#8217;re left with is some very black and white features with little possibility of significant evolution. Eventually all user interfaces, performance, storage, and remote access features will level out, leaving businesses in the email space little to improve on in order to take customers away from their competitors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I was mowing the lawn, and inhaled something up my nose. I proceeded to sneeze violently for a few minutes, and then every few hours after that. I figured it was a piece of grass or something.</p>
<p>I wish it was a piece of grass. The next morning I sneezed in the shower, and well, let&#8217;s just say I figured out what had flown up my nose the day before. Let your imagine run wild &#8211; it needs to. A common house fly had been in my head, surely alive for part of the time, for over 18 hours. The sneezing stopped after that.</p>
<p>Later that day I was skateboarding at the skatepark. A sparrow or similar type of small lightning fast bird took offense to me for a transgression I&#8217;ll never know and felt it appropriate to dart at my head a few times. It never did make contact, it was all for show. It stopped eventually, and I&#8217;d put it out of my mind until it crashed into my head while I was moving quickly. I swung back to where it had thudded into my helmet, and found it knocked cold, wings stretched out and feathers disheveled on the concrete. I picked it up, and set it on the bordering grass. I meant to check on it before I left, but I was already on my way home when I remembered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been holding off on writing an new entries because I&#8217;ve been slowly, as time permitted, building up the new site in Movable Type.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, I&#8217;m feeling some pain. Old URLs aren&#8217;t perfectly mapped. I&#8217;ve written a rudimentary &#8220;smart&#8221; error system that can sends users from old URLs to new URLs, but in order to make it really work I need to put about 1200 URLs into a database, and figure out a way to perfectly map the old to the new without having to do each one by hand.</p>
<p>But I think I&#8217;ll enjoy using MT. The new site is actually four weblogs squeezed into one. The photos on the left are driven by their own blog so that all I have to do to post a photo is create a new entry. The &#8220;Found Links&#8221; and &#8220;Recommended&#8221; on the right are done the same way. The main site, of course, is it&#8217;s own blog.</p>
<p>I like this setup because one of the things that&#8217;s slowed me down the most in posting content to my site is getting the data there quickly and easily. I hadn&#8217;t developed very good tools for my home-brewed system and I think that was really slowing me down. There are tons of ways to get data into MT, most of those ways are very speedy.</p>
<p>So, over the next few days I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m be making some bug fixes, and linking up orphaned stuff from the old site. Bear with me as it all comes back together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been spending some time here and there preparing to convert this site to a fully MovableType powered site complete with a photoblog, remaindered links, code formatting, and anything else I can squeeze in that I find useful.</p>
<p>With the upgrade I have the opportunity to introduce some pretty cool functionality to the site, both on the admin side and on the front end. But what I can&#8217;t find, that I need help with, is the ability to post new entries via IM.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sort of figured out the details in my head &#8211; I could set up an IM bot on my webserver that could then post what it receives to MT. But then, that&#8217;s some serious rigging &#8211; is there a simpler way?</p>
<p>Also, in my searches, I found someone who&#8217;s managed to <a href="http://kairosnews.org/node/view/3896">IM enable the comments on his site</a> &#8211; not only can you post a comment through IM, but when others post comments, their comments are distributed to all users who posted comments to that entry previously. Instead of just witty comments in response to your entry, you get something sorely missed on most comment enabled entries &#8211; actual conversation.</p>
<hr />

<p>But then I take it too far &#8211; what if I could do everything from IM. Seriously &#8211; if I had an Internet enabled refrigerator (whatever that really means) I could send it an IM asking &#8220;Hey, how much butter do you have&#8221; and it could respond &#8220;I have fourteen sticks of butter, only six of which are toast crumb free&#8221;. I could ask my bank what my current balance was. I could tell my bill pay contact to pay the mortgage. I could order a book from Amazon. I could manage my entire life through IM.</p>
<p>What it boils down to, basically, is giving everything/everyone I currently interact with (electronic devices, web sites, people, financial entities, my aquarium) an Internet presence with the capability for me to remotely send commands and receive responses. IM, with little to no improvements, would be a great vehicle for that, especially now that it&#8217;s in cell phones, PDAs, and on every computer platform.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fifteen days can go by in the blink of an eye when you&#8217;re working from home. I don&#8217;t have a morning commute, so I don&#8217;t listen to the radio as much, so I&#8217;m out of the loop when it comes to world news. I don&#8217;t experience as many story worthy events. I don&#8217;t have much human interaction beyond my family and online contacts.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll tell you what I do have: bare feet, an office where I can crank my music up without offending anyone, an electric guitar in my office, Legos on the floor, skateboarding videos playing on one of three monitors, and a ton of ideas not influenced by world politics or events. I have the office I&#8217;d have if I were so stinking rich that I could afford to just be creative, and a job that lets me be creative most of the time.</p>
