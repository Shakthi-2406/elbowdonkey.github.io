  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I was waiting for a flight yesterday a business man and his business man friend sat down a few seats away from me with Outback Steakhouse to go. The man removed the food from the largish brown paper bag and began to sneeze somewhat violently with the bag up to his face, the bag reverberating with each sneeze.</p>
<p>The third and final sneeze sounded a bit different then the rest, as it was also the moment he began to vomit into the same bag, somewhat noisily. A distinctive enough noise that others looked up from books and magazines to try and convince themselves that they had not heard what they just heard.</p>
<p>His business partner was obviously concerned and/or repulsed, but the barf bag man put him at ease by saying &#8220;this happens every time I sneeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maintaining my composure and not laughing like a hyena was super difficult to say the least. It didn&#8217;t help that he dug right into his take away steak without so much as a trip to the restroom to freshen up or even a quick rinse of the mouth. Three sneezes, puke, eat a steak.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Erik showed me an article on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000610023097/">how to modify the graphics on an iPod</a> which is interesting, though the most it seems you can do is change the flashing &#8220;Do Not Disconnect&#8221; graphic. Doing so apparently voids the warranty, and considering that of the four other people I know who own iPods, half of them have had their iPod replaced under warranty, I&#8217;m not messing with anything. I fully expect, based on historical evidence, for my iPod to turn into anti-matter at some point, cancelling out all matter surrounding it in a flash of brilliant energy release, leaving me with nothing to listen to but the sound of myself vaporizing in the universe crushing event.</p>
<p>But today on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot.org</a> I ran across a link to <a href="http://www.ipodlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page">ipodlinux.org.</a> They&#8217;ve developed a Linux distribution that should run on the iPod, and of course the first thing I think of is &#8220;Maybe I can get ColdFusion to run on my iPod!&#8221; Running ColdFusion on random devices has been a sort of hobby for me. I came very close to getting it to run on my Nokia 3650 Symbian phone, but gave up. I might have to try again sometime.</p>
<p>While browsing ipodlinux.org, I came across something that cast serious questions about the legitimacy of this project. <a href="http://www.ipodlinux.org/index.php/Image:Ipod_tux.jpg">Check out this image.</a> Note that the iPod is not a fourth generation iPod (the arrangement of the buttons is the clear indicator, also, this distribution can&#8217;t run on 4G iPods). Now, note the color of the Penguin&#8217;s feet (fondly named Tux by Linux geeks). Do they look yellow to you? The only iPod capable of displaying the yellow feet of Tux in full color is the 4G iPod Photo.</p>
<p>So, a few conclusions: the image is photoshopped, (or more appropriately, as Erik put it, Gimp&#8217;d), it has something to do with the angle of the <span class="caps">LCD</span> screen to the camera, or the backlighting is messing with the camera. I think the first conclusion is the most probable. Something smells funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working from my home office for a while now and I fear I might be losing touch with reality. I&#8217;m writing this to my future self so that if the time comes when I must venture out of my home office and work in the real world, I don&#8217;t embarrass myself or my family name.</p>
<p>10 Rules that apply in the real world, in case I forget:</p>
<p>1. Talking to yourself in Spanish will only confuse your team.<br />
2. Reduce cat naps. Devise sophisticated early warning system if cube/office configurations permit.<br />
3. Belching isn&#8217;t polite.<br />
4. Loud music is discourage.<br />
5. Taking your shirt off when you&#8217;re hot isn&#8217;t a good idea.<br />
6. Other human beings are not just FedEx employees, but coworkers.<br />
7. Waste gas elimination procedure can be performed in workspaces other than your own now.<br />
8. Sheepskin slippers are discouraged.<br />
9. Shower daily before work. Don&#8217;t wait until lunch.<br />
10. Always wear pants.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past week or two my stomach muscles have been twitching.</p>
<p>Or maybe they haven&#8217;t, and my worst fear of all time has come true &#8211; I have a parasitic worm in my gut and the twitches I feel are actually worm movements, as he/she/it changes positions to get more comfortable.</p>
<p>Seriously, how would I know if I had a tapeworm or something? Does anyone truly know the symptoms? I&#8217;ve been eating a lot more lately, but it was Thanksgiving, so it&#8217;s hard to say if my consumption is above normal. I&#8217;m pretty tired a lot too, but it is Fall/Winter* and I think that&#8217;s normal for me.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I have no idea when seasons actually start or stop. I grew up in Southern California where we had four seasons &#8211; Fires, Floods, Earthquakes, or Lack of Fires, Floods and Earthquakes. All I know is that right now, outside, it&#8217;s pretty cold and nasty and stuff is frosty most mornings.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Wednesday I tried a new hair cut store. Instead of the usual Great Clips, I tried Super Cuts. I thought Super must be better than Great, and wondered why I hadn&#8217;t gone with the most superlative right from the start.</p>
<p>Within a few seconds of starting to spray my hair and comb it out, the hair cut lady said, as if I&#8217;d been searching for answers all along and she was it: &#8220;Oh. You have Mexican hair. You should always get your hair cut by a Mexican. I&#8217;m Mexican, so I know this.&#8221;</p>
<p>That got her a smile, but the smile was covering up the whirlwind of thoughts. Not only am I not Mexican, I&#8217;m not even close to being ethnic. I&#8217;m nearly as white as humanly possible, and could only get more white if my freckles, thrown up as a futile attempt against the blistering sun, were removed. How my hair became Mexican was dumbfounding.</p>
<p>I decided that while my hair might be Mexican like she said, it all comes down to a matter of biological mechanics. Observe,  if you will, Illustrations 3a and 3b.</p>
<p><img alt="acute_angle.gif" src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/acute_angle.gif" width="537" height="275" border="0" /></p>
<p>Illustration 3a shows the hair that comes out of normal human beings. The follicle is quite happy to just make hair go straight out. The hair is then influenced by gravity, hairspray, combs, etc.</p>
<p>Illustration 3b is my hair. The follicle flunked first grade, and missed the part about coming out of the head at a proper angle. It&#8217;s shooting for a 45 degree angle, and because of this and the combined perfectly straightness of my hair, makes my hair impossible to control.</p>
<p>While thinking about this as the hair cut lady was doing her thing, she said &#8220;Mexican hair comes out at an angle just like your hair, and is very straight. I bet your hair grows fast too.&#8221; She was totally right. And she did a fine job of cutting my hair. Whether I have Mexican hair or not is a matter for Science, but I do know this &#8211; I&#8217;ll be getting my hair cut by her again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think maybe I should have been a lumberjack instead of messing with computers.</p>
<p>The thing about being a lumberjack is that your tasks are pretty simple. You put on your flannel shirt, your boots, and your gloves, and you pick up your ax and look for a nice tree to fell. Once you&#8217;ve found it, you figure out where you want it to fall and then begin swinging your ax at the trunk like you&#8217;re a machine until it falls over.</p>
<p>Then you tell someone to pick it up while you head home. Your day&#8217;s work complete, you spend the rest of the afternoon and evening reading poetry, or bouncing children around and impress your spouse with your impressive muscles.</p>
<p>Computers are constantly fighting with each other, and humans keep figuring out more complicated ways of making computers fight with each other. You can&#8217;t just swing axes and make stuff fall down, first you have to figure out if you&#8217;re even holding an axe, and is the axe made of metal or rubber, and can the axe even be swung. And if the axe can be swung, when you swing it, will it cut through the air with ease or jump around like a flopping fish? Are you even in a forest?</p>
<p>Being a lumberjack produces obvious results. Forests get cleared, people see you swinging axes and knocking trees down, you work up a sweat, get calluses, chop off an appendage on bad days.</p>
<p>Programming computers produces nothing. Nothing physical at least. The worst callus you get is from pushing a mouse around, and the only time you sweat is when something is supposed to be happening, but isn&#8217;t, and suddenly every computer you own is maxed out.</p>
<p>And being a lumberjack probably means you smell pine fresh, as opposed to geek foul.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost a year ago I wrote about the <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2003/12/catch_and_relea.html">terrible mouse incident.</a></p>
<p>Last night I was playing a game in my office and heard Carrie out doing something in the kitchen. When I finished up, I went out to see what she was doing but she wasn&#8217;t there, though the sound she was making continued. The sound of her eating apples. I saw that the baby monitor was on, so I turned it off, and the sound stopped.</p>
<p>As I was heading out of the kitchen, I heard the apple eating sound again. I immediately suspected invasive animal activity and crept back to the center of the kitchen to find the sound coming out from underneath the dishwasher, and the sound was loud. Loud enough to travel to the opposite leg of the L of our house to my office.</p>
<p>I ran out to the garage, got a bear trap style mouse trap, baited it with a bit of peanut butter, and figured I&#8217;d tear apart the kitchen the next day to destroy all possible modes of entry by rodent.</p>
<p>This morning Carrie came running into the room nearly giggling with glee and said &#8220;You got him! Now get him out of my kitchen!&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. A year ago, the mouse was too smart for me. This year, I didn&#8217;t even give him a chance to grow familiar with my trap. I considered taking a photograph, but thought that a photo of a mouse clamped in the jaws of death, flattened nearly like you might imagine it to happen in cartoons, wouldn&#8217;t be pleasant on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still going to tear apart the kitchen, or at least pull out the dishwasher to clean out any mouse homes, and seal all entries. I suspect that I&#8217;ll be seeing more mice as the temps outside start to get colder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night while watching two men who spent a heap of money each and who had spent the last year or so trying to convince other people that they were the men for the job, a thought, or more like a formulation came into my mind.</p>
<p>Presidential candidates from 2000 and on have and will continue to nearly tie each other unless some kind of secret campaigning strategy is employed by one of the candidates that truly tips the scales in their favor. Because I know that future presidential candidates and their campaign managers, or even supporters, don&#8217;t read my site, I can reveal the following ideas while still keeping them secret for future use.</p>
<p>1. Future Presidential Candidates (<span class="caps">FPC</span>) can gain a competitive edge by endorsing all manner of product, for free. Imagine if it had happened for yesterday&#8217;s election. &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m John Kerry, and I implore you to take a nibble of this Reese&#8217;s Peanut Butter cup. Simply divine. Vote for me in &#8217;04.&#8221; Note that the last sentence would be squeezed in &#8220;legal terms fast speak&#8221;. If American Idol can get more people to vote for it than America can for a President, surely endorsing scrumptious candy would help.</p>
<p>2. If the growth rate of campaign fund trends continue (almost doubling every election)*, the 2016 election would be a good one to invent the cash cannon for. Picture a bazooka loaded with cash, and teams of campaign volunteers who fire it out of car windows at random pedestrians while yelling &#8220;Vote for Schwartz!&#8221; [though the Schwartz I&#8217;m thinking of likely wouldn&#8217;t try this idea]. Invent the money mortar while you&#8217;re at it to help spread the funds around even more. At current rates you could fire wads of $133 at random if you hoped to &#8220;influence&#8221; 14,520,000 constituents. This idea is risky, but if that was your only tactic, I&#8217;m sure that might win some points from someone somewhere.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Starting with Bush vs. Gore in 2004: $138.1M vs $71.8M, Bush vs. Kerry in 2004: $242M vs $223.4M. If campaigns nearly doubled what Bush spent each election, in 2016 candidates would spend nearly $1.9B. 14M is a number I picked at random, thinking it might be close to 20% of 250M (my guess at US population in 2016). I was close. It&#8217;s 17%, a healthy number to shoot for.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. In 2010 a secret R&amp;D group will stumble upon the perfect voice recognition algorithm, capable of running on cheap Pentium 4&#8217;s. Another secret R&amp;D group will perfect voice synthesis. They&#8217;ll join forces and spend the next 4 years programming a truly artificially intelligent application that will be able to joke, gossip, listen to your deepest concerns and be as consoling and attentive as anyone ever could be. For the entire two years leading up to the election, the candidate who controls this secret technology will unleash perfectly intelligent robot minions of himself to call people on the telephone, win over their friendship and loyalty by calling regularly and asking how the kids are doing and did the dog get paper trained yet and oh you got a paper cut just now doesn&#8217;t that suck. They&#8217;ll never know it was a robot. The robots will continue to operate when the candidate is elected to keep ratings high, and ensure the reelection.</p>
<p>4. In 2024, the once secret R&amp;D groups will reveal the scandal, admit they were behind all the nice phone calls, and suggest that they, as a independent entity, be able to run as President, using their vast array of upgraded PowerMac G10 Quantum Inside chips to calculate the best possible solution to any presidential problem.</p>
<p>5. In 2028, the once secret R&amp;D group, now known as Muffin Man, will slip up in the lab, and a lavender (not gray, to everyone&#8217;s disbelief and confusion) goo will dissemble every human being on the planet and reassemble them into Tootsie rolls, which will be used to power the new leader of the free world&#8217;s nano assembly plants. We don&#8217;t know what happens beyond that, because of the initial disassembly bit.</p>
