  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s a shame that within a day or so I won&#8217;t be able to continue watching the British show called Young Posh and Loaded because I&#8217;m going home. The show follows teenagers/early twenties kids who have absolutely filthy rich parents, and follows them as they follow their &#8220;ambitions&#8221;. The show basically gives you enough fodder to mock the filthy rich for being such idiots, but at the same time makes you want to kick their collective asses for pissing away so much money.</p>
<p>As an example, their following the daughter of a British politician who&#8217;s also a billionaire. She&#8217;s white as a lily, has a fine British accent, and is breaking onto the rap/hip-hop scene in Manhattan, because, as she puts it, Manhattan is the &#8220;get-toe&#8221;. She&#8217;s also a belly dancer (she&#8217;s had a lesson), and plans on combining rap and belly dancing, because she has the talent, and she&#8217;s convinced that she&#8217;ll topple the boy bands as well as Christina and Britney.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mess up, keep dancing, the audience is too stupid to know&#8221;. Yeah. Keep it up there smarty, and I&#8217;ll keep my eye out for you on <span class="caps">TRL</span>.</p>
<p>Speaking of going home, I&#8217;ve been growing my beard to look like one of the dudes in the Kings of Leon, and learned whatever song they&#8217;ve been playing over and over here (a power chord with a well timed finger lift), and I plan on having a full on rock and roll guitar smashing of the guitar I bought from the back of some dude&#8217;s car for twenty quid. It&#8217;s going to be fantastic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m currently literally within the 11th hour of a gigantic coding project at work. A tool that&#8217;s to be used by hundreds of internal Xerox users as well as any number of thousands of end users. Some serious effort has been put into the design of the project. Lots of workflow considerations, lots of role based stuff,&nbsp; tons of business practices and control issues to consider, and countless other requirements.</p>
<p>As in most big projects, there have beens lessons learned, and while I&#8217;m still nursing my wounds and still totally into make numbered lists it&#8217;s probably a good idea to make some notes for future reference:</p>
<p><strong>1. Roles</strong><br />When developing a roles based system, spend as much time as possible considering all the things each role can do. It might even help to do this while coming up with the overall requirements of the project, as they often coincide. For example, if an admin level user can do everything within the tool, you have to define what everything actually is. An end user might only be able to do one thing out of the list of everything, but you still need to define the list of everything.</p>
<p><strong>2. What it Needs to Do<br /></strong><p>Spend a considerable amount of time designing a functional specification (again, can coincide with developing roles). If the functional spec is vague, it can completely and utterly derail development cycles, costing time, money, and possibly developer mutiny. Functional specifications must be as clear as possible, and shouldn&#8217;t say a single thing about how to create the project assets, it should simply describe exactly a function is supposed to do. It should be concise to the point that a developer can create with a high degree of accuracy exactly what is required. Involve smart people when creating the functional spec. People who know what&#8217;s technically possible, who are intimate with business processes, and even developers, usability experts, and people who will be using the tool.</p><br />
<p><strong>3. How to Do It<br /></strong>Spend a considerable amount of time developing a technical specification. This almost mirrors the functional specification, except that it describes how to develop the functionality. It talks about what tools will be used, what already created assets are available, and how they&#8217;ll fit in, and how new assets will be designed. Java developers would be describing objects and classes here, <span class="caps">CFMX</span> developers would be describing CFCs, Perl developers: modules and such. It&#8217;s not the actual code &#8211; it&#8217;s a recipe for how to cook up the project.</p><br />
<p><strong>4. Rinse and Repeat as Needed<br /></strong>Run through steps 1 &#8211; 3 several times with interested parties. Make them as clear as possible. Leave no stone unturned, and do it with the same kind of intensity as if the project were due tomorrow. Do it until you&#8217;re sick. Do it even if it means that the functional requirements have changed 10 times within the process. Do it until it changes no more. All specs must be etched in stone, at least for this version.</p><br />
<p><strong>5. Do It<br /></strong>Write the code as specified. Any new specifications are to be done in the next version.</p><br />
<p><strong>6. Test<br /></strong>Test the code, using the functional spec as the criteria. If something doesn&#8217;t match the functional spec, or if there is a bug, open a trouble ticket in a proper trouble ticket system. </p><br />
<p>The trouble ticket system needs priority levels, issue numbers, roles (to track who says what and allow for some moderation), threaded conversations related to the issue (so that dialog surrounding the issue can be read easily). The&nbsp; trouble ticket system should be flexible enough to merge duplicated issues, but not so flexible that it turns into a chaotic mess. Technical people need to be able to be able to ask non-technical people questions, for screen shots, for specific error messages, data to test with, and more.</p><br />
<p>Testing needs to be scientific, and needs to be tested in the same environment. You can&#8217;t have testers testing on a staging server with data that differs from the development or production server.</p><br />
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Keep Control<br /></strong>Use a version control system. An absolute must. Before releasing an application to the staging server, a release candidate should be migrated to the staging server. Bugs found in testing beyond that should be fixed with specific releases of versions. It should always be known that Issue <em>n</em> was cleared up with a&nbsp;Release Candidate 0.89 release for example.</p><br />
<p><strong>8. Freeze&nbsp;Functionality<br /></strong>Never introduce new functionality during testing. Never. Ever. Don&#8217;t let anyone involved in the project even think about it. </p><br />
<p><strong>9. Use the Best<br /></strong>Hire the best talent you can. Drop problem developers as quickly as possible. If someone is creating rubbish code, and you&#8217;re in a rush to get a big project done, you shouldn&#8217;t be babysitting and cleaning up. Professional developers can handle intense schedules while still writing exceptional code.</p><br />
<p><strong>10. Do a Fine Job</strong><br />Enjoy doing all of the above. Release a good piece of software. Prepare for the next version.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m under a &#8220;Hottest day ever&#8221; computer use policy today, which means less typing, so blog updates shall be terse. I dare not touch a computer unless the full arctic wind of an air con unit is forming icicles on every square inch of my body that doesn&#8217;t end in icles already.</p>
<p>There was a hedge hog duel in my back garden last night. Or maybe it was a mating dance. All that can be said for sure is that hedgehogs are heavy breathers, and that running full force at one produces behavior that&#8217;s not in the least bit exciting. Complete buzz kill. Hedgehogs just sit there, thinking up clever lottery numbers while you stomp about like the Yeti.</p>
<p>Carrie saw her first hedgehog the night before leaving to the States. She has arrived safely despite the fact that the escalator into the customs pit at <span class="caps">LAX</span> kept feeding people into an already shoulder to shoulder room, effectively crushing people into the room as only a machine can until someone pulled the emergency stop lever. Leah was an angel for the 12 hour flight, and was quite excited about being in the airplane (an object she&#8217;s been quite enthused about lately, having lived near Heathrow for a third of her life).</p>
<p>Our back garden has been a veritable <a href="http://www.wildamerica.com/index.htm" target="">Wild America</a> <p>with Marty Stouffer, with a noticeable lack of Marty and America. We&#8217;ve seen at least three hedgehogs, six guinea pigs, three or four cats, countless birds, swarms of bees, humans, and no less than one <em>Tapirus bairdii</em><strong>. Half of these animals we saw in the last few weeks as we&#8217;ve taken to eating outside in the evenings to get out of the brick oven that we also sleep in. If only we&#8217;d eaten outside all along.<br />
<p>I&#8217;m getting ready to leave England to continue being a citizen of the United States of America, where, for real, I will be homeless, without a car, and have only a few dollars on my person. My wallet has gone missing, which includes my credit card, <span class="caps">ATM</span> card, and drivers license, which makes it difficult to be an American. I&#8217;m trying to decide whether or not saying I was pick pocketed sounds a bit romantic, or just makes me look like a total fool. I have a few days to come up with a good story anyhow. Pirates.</p><br />
<p> It was either a Tapir, or a clever plant. No plant is more clever than a Venus fly trap, and everyone knows they can&#8217;t handle an English winter. Therefore, tapir.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was the hottest day in UK history. And there&#8217;s a lot of history to compare against. King Henry <span class="caps">VIII</span> wasn&#8217;t even lucky enough to feel 37&deg; Celcius in his day.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t exactly feel lucky, I feel sweaty. England hasn&#8217;t yet invented air conditioning. Why would they, with cold and damp weather? They did think to make windows that open, but they forgot to make screens to keep the bugs out. So it&#8217;s either bugs or bake quicker.</p>
<p>Today is also supposed to be the hottest day in UK history, beating the long standing record set on August 6, 2003 of 37&deg;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How to become a web super star in 10 easy steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pick Something<br /></strong><p>Pick one thing you truly enjoy doing. It doesn&#8217;t have to be about computers or anything even remotely computer related, but it has to be about something you would enjoy doing for the rest of your life. It can be a subject as mundane as &#8220;I truly enjoy sitting Indian style for hours and doing nothing more&#8221; or a subject as equally mundane as &#8220;I enjoy studying the mass of protons found in iron atoms.&#8221; But pick something. And just one thing for right now. It&#8217;s OK to keep a list of standbys, but pick the one thing you enjoy the most to start.</p><br />
<p><strong>2. Become an Expert<br /></strong>Become an expert on what you truly enjoy doing. You may think you know a lot about what you enjoy, but you can always know more. Use the Internet, compile lists, make diagrams, study it, go to the library, talk to people, lots of people, see what they think. Make flash cards, live it, breath it, drive the people you love absolutely bonkers. Exhaust yourself learning all there is to know about your subject, then test yourself by executing step 3 while continuing on with step 2.</p><br />
<p><strong>3. Start a Weblog<br /></strong>Start a weblog. You need no computer skills for this, there are people who are experts at creating weblog software, and they&#8217;ve done all the work for you. All you need to know is how to connect to the Internet and how to go to a website to update your own weblog. See Appendix A for how to start a weblog. Your weblog helps you test your knowledge. Post entries about what you&#8217;re learning, and about what you know. Write in a way that encourages people to ask you questions. Don&#8217;t be afraid of being wrong, you will be at least once, probably a lot more. You need that. It will encourage you to grow. Continue step 3 while doing the next step.</p><br />
<p><strong>4. Communicate<br /></strong>Understand where you fit in, or where you can/will fit in. A weblog isn&#8217;t very effective or useful for others if they don&#8217;t know about it. Go to sites where the subject matter is related to what you&#8217;re an expert on, and write comments on the sites. Talk to the authors via email. Ask them questions, challenge their ideas. Go to community sites and find opportunities to share your knowledge and become part of communities (see Appendix B for community sites).</p><br />
<p><strong>5. Write Well</strong><br />Continue steps 2 through 4 for a good portion of nearly every day of your life. Make it your job. Continue improving your writing and online communication skills. Learn more about how to talk to your audience through your weblog posts. Be practical, and know calls for attention will get you no where. Good, quality weblog posts in high frequency will have far more punch than &#8220;Is anyone out there?&#8221; posts. Don&#8217;t share too much. Retain a certain degree a privacy by not posting personal email addresses (use a public one), or telling people where you live and what your bank account numbers are. Stay on topic as much as possible, and put in at the very least a new entry daily. Don&#8217;t worry about short entries, they are usually more effective. But do at least post daily, if not more. </p><br />
<p>Include links to sites you&#8217;ve used in coming up with your post, if possible. Have you discovered a way to prevent your legs from falling asleep while sitting indian style? Give credit where credit is due, and encourage your audience to read your sources. </p><br />
<p>Make it interesting. It&#8217;s your show, you can use humor, you should write in a consistent voice, and typically writing in the first person makes the most sense. Your subject is a part of you, and touches you in a way that motivates you to write about it. Make that clear to your audience.</p><br />
<p><strong>6. Gain an Audience<br /></strong>Do nothing, except for the previous steps. Don&#8217;t, for a second, worry that your audience isn&#8217;t big enough. It will be if you&#8217;re doing your job according to the previous steps. Avoid thinking about the numbers, or looking at them at all. Big numbers can scare you into not posting. Small numbers can frustrate you. Worry not about the size of your audience. Continue improving your writing and communication skills, and keep your knowledge up on the subject matter.</p><br />
<p><strong>7. Look for Opportunities<br /></strong>Use your weblog to get yourself writing gigs, for news sites, for magazines, for newspapers. The perceived stakes are higher (can&#8217;t delete an article printed in thousands of magazines), but it&#8217;s not much different than writing a weblog entry. Build a pile of published works writing directly on your favorite subject. Don&#8217;t worry about getting paid yet. Look for opportunities to speak publicly about your subject. Use your work, your church, find special interest groups, community centers, trains, street corners, cafes. Become comfortable with speaking to groups of people face to face. It will improve your writing skills, and increase your confidence of how well you know your topic. Give people the opportunity to learn about your site. Use it as part of your author&#8217;s or speaker&#8217;s bio. &#8220;So and so also writes about cuttlefish husbandry at his/her site&#8221;.</p><br />
<p><strong>8. Choose Opportunities<br /></strong>If you&#8217;ve been diligent about the steps above, you will have people asking for your time. This is a wonderful thing. It&#8217;s proof that what you&#8217;re doing is not in vain, but it also means that you can choose your opportunities. It means that you don&#8217;t have to work so hard looking for opportunities (no more going to the senior center to explain breastfeeding to elderly women) and it&#8217;s likely the opportunities will be more suited to further success. Opportunities that come to you can typically pay you cash as well, which helps you succeed in all steps leading to step 8.</p><br />
<p><strong>9. Persevere<br /></strong>Never give up. Continue pushing forward towards your goal of becoming an expert who can present subject matter in a captivating matter. While it&#8217;s unlikely, it is possible that the joy you have of your subject matter is not shared by anyone else. Consider a standby topic, and start the process again. Evaluate your writing skills. Admit to yourself that you suck at writing, and could use a class. Learn how to express your opinions or how to share what you know in more interesting ways. Ask for opinions. Improve yourself. Don&#8217;t drive anyone crazy though.</p><br />
<p><strong>10. Avoid Head Bloat</strong><br />Enjoy being a web super star. But be humble. All of your efforts will be in vain the exact second you decide that you&#8217;re better than a single one of your audience. Continue to work hard, seize good opportunities, share, give credit, support others, be cheerful, be kind. Most of all, be honest and humble.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just signed up for a <a href="http://www.typepad.com" target="">typepad</a> <p>account, and I&#8217;m quite floored by how good it is. It&#8217;s fair to say that <a href="http://www.stupidfool.org/" target="">Ben</a>, <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/" target="">Mena</a>, and <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/" target="">Anil</a> (and whoever else has had their nose to the grindstone) have been incredibly busy. It&#8217;s quite good (that&#8217;s British for &#8220;damn it&#8217;s good&#8221;).</p><br />
<p>The photo albums are my favorite feature so far. It was the one thing missing from MoveableType that was really stopping me from using MT full time. typepad&#8217;s Photo Albums are exactly what I&#8217;d want. They&#8217;re configurable, easy to use, have good resizing and thumbnail creation, and allow me to easily create very clean and bright photo albums.</p><br />
<p>And there are features beyond that that I&#8217;m still taking in. I&#8217;m not sure what to make of Typelists yet, but I can see myself posting lists of the books I&#8217;m reading, in the hopes that I might increase my Amazon credits in order to buy more books. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve attempted to do with little success on my own blog software, so hopefully having typelists will make a difference for me.</p><br />
<p>Something I hadn&#8217;t considered much that I find to be a fantastic idea is the trouble ticket system built into the typepad application. It&#8217;s easy to find, and has a very clear and easy to follow tracking system. Found a bug? Simple, open a ticket, and you&#8217;ll know when it&#8217;s fixed. I&#8217;m sure that it also makes managing bugs and other issues much easier for the team behind the software. If they&#8217;ve made the backend to it only half as elegant (as it always seems to be with public website software) they&#8217;ll have an easy time making an already excellent piece of software better.</p><br />
<p>A couple of things strike me right away about typepad that I think are quite deliberate, and well planned. It&#8217;s designed for pure simplicity. I can see my Mom using typepad (I&#8217;ve already set up a blog for her) and being able to use it well without much trouble, and minimal learning curve. But that simplicity doesn&#8217;t stop me, an advanced computer user, from taking full advantage of typepad. I can edit templates to my hearts content, although I am limited to the features typepad has (can&#8217;t plug in all sorts of MT plugins as far as I can see, but also, I have no need for them). I&#8217;ve played with Blogger, and Blogger simply doesn&#8217;t have simplicity so well planned. (And it&#8217;s all so pleasant on the eyes and easy to read as well.)</p><br />
<p>I think that combined with the features and simplicity, typepad has an easy chance of becoming dominant. It simply can&#8217;t be ignored, and will likely lure hardcore MT users as well as people just getting into weblogs. It&#8217;ll probably encourage people who never thought of having a weblog into having one.</p><br />
<p>And while I gush about it, there are things to be desired. I&#8217;d like to be able to point a domain name at any one of my typepad blogs (it&#8217;s coming soon Anil tells me). I&#8217;m concerned that the bandwidth restrictions on the most premium account are not enough. My combined bandwidth usage across my photo albums, personal site and stinkfactor.com come very near or actually go beyond the limit. But at $14.95 a month for unlimited weblogs, this is hardly something to complain about. Disk space is also a concern, but we&#8217;ll just play it by ear.</p><br />
<p>Overall, I highly recommend giving it a try. I&#8217;ll keep reporting what I think of it once/if the puppy love dies off.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you ever find yourself in a position where you think that watching The Sweetest Thing is a good idea you must instead promptly stuff your head in a toilet and flush it three times, just to give yourself a sampling of what you might have subjected yourself to instead.</p>
<p>The entire collective cast and crew&nbsp;of that movie should be banned from ever, and I do mean <strong>ever</strong> <p>being involved in making&nbsp;movies again.</p><br />
<p>And Cameron Diaz can look attractive and dog ass ugly within milleseconds. The more I see of her, the more I think she&#8217;s 80% dog ass ugly. Christina Applegate wasn&#8217;t as nearly as annoying, but that&#8217;s because she was far eclipsed by Cameron Diaz&#8217; sand-in-the-eyes annoyance. Christina is more like lemon juice in paper cuts.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html" target="">Nokia 3650</a> <p>mobile phone, which has all sorts of features. One of the most potentially powerful features is it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/" target="">Bluetooth</a> connectivity. Bluetooth, for years now, has been touted as the nirvana of all things related to personal technology. It&#8217;s cheap ($5.00 typically), which means adding it to a device shouldn&#8217;t make the price of the device skyrocket, and allows for connecting all sorts of other Bluetooth devices to it without wires while taking advantage of low power consumption.</p><br />
<p>There are things like <a href="http://www.xocute.com/product_list.asp?code=45" target="">wireless headsets</a> and <a href="http://www.flexis.co.kr/web/fxcubebt.htm" target="">wireless keyboards</a> (hopefully coming soon, I could really benefit from one) and so far not much else out there. It&#8217;s not yet where it could so easily be.</p><br />
<p>I want to see Bluetooth wrist watches that are in constant sync with my Bluetooth phone. When my phone rings in my pocket, I want my watch to display the caller ID text. I want a Bluetooth hard drive, so I can just offload photos from my phone to the hard drive. I want stereo Bluetooth headphones. My Nokia 3650 can play MP3&#8217;s, but they sound like crap over the regular phone speaker. I want Bluetooth light switches, so that when I walk into a room with my Bluetooth wrist watch on, the lights turn on. And turn off when I leave. I want my car to adjust it&#8217;s climate control, seats&nbsp;and mirrors to suit me, via a profile on my Bluetooth phone/watch/keychain. I want a Bluetooth toothbrush that sends a reminder to my computer which then synchronizes with my phone to tell me when I should buy a new one. I want my toaster to trigger a pleasant little chime in my ear when the sourdough has crisped. Essentially, I want Bluetooth enabled everything.</p><br />
<p>And maybe Bluetooth isn&#8217;t up for the job, but certainly, there are alternatives. If it&#8217;s not Bluetooth, it can be some kind of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000066JQU/" target="">WiFi device</a>&nbsp;(make any Ethernet enabled device wireless), or whatever, but the point is that it&#8217;s possible. We have the technology, but no one is really truly&nbsp;innovating with it. Hardware developers are putting out hardware that&#8217;s just like everything else, and they&#8217;re using Bluetooth or WiFi&nbsp;as merely&nbsp;buzzwords, but not as a true ultra powerful features.</p><br />
<p>I think that possibly the reason why wireless technologies aren&#8217;t showing up in my toothbrushes and toaster ovens is because, and forgive me for stating the obvious, the technology is still young. It&#8217;s so young that wireless devices aren&#8217;t yet <em>really</em> easy to write code for, and hardware manufacturers are putting in the bare minimum of effort&nbsp;to keep the profits high. If wireless technology was as easy to implement and write code for as buttering bread, the world would be a different place (and I&#8217;d probably be out of a job).</p><br />
<p>You&#8217;d think with the decades that we&#8217;ve had to come up with proper programming languages that certainly we could come up with something that was so easy that nearly anyone could make use of it. Currently,&nbsp;writing Bluetooth, <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP, or most other hardware/software code is out of the scope of most&nbsp;developers&#8217; understanding. If&nbsp;we could jump that hurdle and come up with an &#8220;easy&#8221; (easy meaning easy for my&nbsp;Grandma)&nbsp;language with easy, simple, yet potentially powerful hardware, we could be in technology nirvana.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had my fill. I&#8217;m ready to go back to the US now. I have a few more weeks still, but they should go quickly.</p>
<p>I miss the States, and it&#8217;s just about as simple as that. I miss what&#8217;s familiar (even if things in England have become familiar) but I miss what&#8217;s <em>really</em> <p>familiar.</p><br />
<p>Problem is, when I go home, I&#8217;ll be completely homeless. Carrie will be in California, and I&#8217;ll be in Oregon, securing a home, without a car, or a home. It&#8217;s going to be interesting that&#8217;s for sure.</p><br />
<p>And poor Leah. I did some calculations, and by the time she flys back to California, she will have averaged 300 travelled miles a day. It&#8217;s hard to even fathom.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider this a how to guide on how to get utterly confused, yet delighted at the same time:</p>
<p>Stumble half asleep down the stairs of immeasurable steepness, where floppiness and arm flailing increases friction, slowing the descent.</p>
<p>Discover, for the third time, that the thimble sized washer/dryer hidden underneath the kitchen sink has once again failed to dry all the whites.</p>
<p>Search in vain for anything that might be hanging up to dry in the conservatory. Resolve to go commando.</p>
<p>Stop dead in tracks as six pairs of beady eyes jump to follow your movements. Hold very still while trying to comprehend what is actually happening.&nbsp;Are there no&nbsp;less than six guinea pigs&nbsp;watching your every move&nbsp;from the back garden?</p>
<p>The results of following these instructions are titillating.</p>
