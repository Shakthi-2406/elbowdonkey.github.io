  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kent Dahlgren launched the site for <a href="http://www.skatersforpublicskateparks.org/">Skaters for Public Skateparks</a> this morning. Kent has been a champion for public skateparks for years, starting with helping build the famous Burnside park. It&#8217;s exciting to see him support what I consider to be such a worthy project.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in helping your community build a public skatepark, Skaters for Public Skateparks is a vital resource run by experts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have iPhoto, <a href="http://www.daikini.com/photon/">Photon</a>, and MT pretty much in perfect tune now.</p>
<p>For iPhoto, I downloaded <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/bwebster/iphotolibrarymanager.html">iPhoto Library Manager</a> so I could move all of my photos to a much faster external drive. The speed difference is quite easily noticeable. I&#8217;m definitely on the cusp of adopting iPhoto for my photo organization as opposed to my own home-brew file naming system.</p>
<p>I also setup Photon to create entries using the excerpt field in MT as a caption. This isn&#8217;t ideal because if I go over a certain character length, the caption doesn&#8217;t get posted to MT. This is particularly painful, as I tend to write a lot.</p>
<p>I updated the photo blog portion of the site so that when a thumbnail on the left is clicked, it goes to a blog entry for that photo. I enjoy comments (ego stroking) on my photos, so this was much needed. I still have to clean up the archive view of the photoblog (I&#8217;ll probably throw together a bunch of thumbnails), but overall, I&#8217;m happy with the progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had another idea, iPod Shuffle related.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see another version that lets you daisy chain shuffles (maybe they snap together like Legos). Once snapped together, they act as one. So if you snap 10 together, you essentially have a 10GB iPod Shuffle. Make it so you can snap off one of them and hand it to a friend, all the songs that sat on that particular Shuffle remaining playable.</p>
<p>Include special edition shuffles in promotions, or create limited editions, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a healthy trading/collecting economy like baseball cards with the additional social benefits of mixed tapes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a 6GB stack might look like:</p>
<p><img alt="iPodStack.jpg" src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/iPodStack.jpg" width="537" height="358" /></p>
<p>Or maybe you&#8217;d have a remote that acted as the &#8220;head&#8221; with controls and a headphone jack, and the storage portions would click together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t tested this at all because I don&#8217;t have an iPod shuffle, but in theory this should work.</p>
<p>Install this <a href="http://www.aimlesswords.com/archives/20041007/gmail_drive/">little tool</a> that makes your <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> account look like a drive. Tell iTunes to use that drive to store its music. Sync up your iPod Shuffle, and know that gmail is keeping a copy of everything on your Shuffle.</p>
<p>The transfer rates between iTunes and gmail probably kill this idea, but it&#8217;s fun to think of anyhow. Also damning the idea is the fact that most people have libraries larger than 1GB, and if your computer loses its brains (making a backup useful) the only way to get at your files is to download them one by one, or install the drive extension tool above on another computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m playing with the new version of iPhoto and <a href="http://www.daikini.com/photon/">Photon</a> and have to say that Photon completely rocks. In as little as three clicks I can export a single photo, or multiple photos, directly to my photoblog. This alone makes me want to use iPhoto more, but also, iPhoto now supports <span class="caps">RAW</span> files.</p>
<p>Two things about the <span class="caps">RAW</span> support though that concern me:</p>
<p>On my 1.2Ghz iBook iPhoto crawls when dealing with <span class="caps">RAW</span> images. This is likely more the fault of the slow hard drive than anything else, but still, a lot of people use <span class="caps">RAW</span> images. Soon, a lot of people will be using the Mac mini (I predict that it will end up the most popular Mac in a pretty short amount of time) and the base specs are very similar to my iBook. The lack of speed is difficult to deal with. I will try moving the photo library to a faster drive, and try it on my G5 when I get a chance.</p>
<p>The second concern &#8211; what does it do with my <span class="caps">RAW</span> images? Hopefully nothing &#8211; I&#8217;d like to think I can use iPhoto as my digital darkroom, retaining my &#8220;negatives&#8221; (the <span class="caps">RAW</span> files) as well as make &#8220;prints&#8221; (modified images). I&#8217;ll have to look into that. If anyone knows, drop me a line.</p>

<p>I rarely see photos of myself skateboarding, so it&#8217;s always a kind of sickening treat when I get to see myself. Skateboarding is such a technical sport, but also chock full of style opportunity. Technically, I&#8217;m doing a 5-0, but style-wise, I look sort of like a monkey.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday morning Jonas, after weeks of trying to rush full speed off the top of the stairs, managed to actually do it before Carrie could get to him quick enough. As Jonas began tumbling head over heels down the stairs, Carrie literally threw herself down the stairs after him. She managed to get in front of him right before the wooden landing. Everyone is fine (Jonas almost seemed excited about the whole thing after he calmed down). Carrie is bruised and sore, but nothing is broken.</p>
<p>I often wonder to myself if when it truly matters, will I be able to react to a situation as clearly and decisively as Carried did. Will I be able to cast aside any excuses to not act and simply act, possibly sacrificing myself in the process? I&#8217;d like to think so. I now know Carrie will.</p>
<p>So yesterday morning she went and bought a gate for the stairs. Normally opposed to drilling holes in our nearly pristine walls, I drilled the hell out of the walls to mount a gate worthy of stopping a stampeding buffalo, let alone a stampeding baby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After playing with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> a little more I have to admit that I like it more than when I first played with it, but it&#8217;s still not what I ultimately settle on to manage my photographs and their online presentation (which is all I&#8217;m currently looking for).</p>
<p>If I remove the thriving community aspect from the idea of Flickr (and the community is indeed thriving, and growing), I&#8217;m left with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to upload photos directly from iPhoto to Flickr or from my OS (nice)</li>
<li>I can place captions on the photos</li>
<li>I can allow others to comment</li>
<li>I can place notes directly on the photograph (I&#8217;m most impressed with this, and will likely not rule out Flickr entirely because of this)</li>
<li>The ability to post photograph back to my weblog</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems as if the only thing I can&#8217;t do, and want to do is modify the default look and feel of Flickr (I mentioned this on my last review, and as far as I know the most I can do to get around this is to post Flickr photos back to my blog, using it&#8217;s templates) &#8211; not exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p>If only Flickr had a templating system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m really interested in Doug Bowman&#8217;s writeup on his <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2005/01/17/galleries.html">great looking photo albums</a> run by Moveable Type. I too run my photos running in the sidebar using Moveable Type, but haven&#8217;t gone beyond making just a sideblog. I&#8217;d love to apply some nice templates to it, open up comments, and have it integrate with iPhoto.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also excited about the next version of iPhoto which should handle <span class="caps">RAW</span> image files with ease. Combine iPhoto with MT and I have everything I could need or want for photo management (as long as I don&#8217;t need to rescue my images with Photoshop). All my photos would sync with my iPod photo, my blog, and my personal computer, all originating from a single app.</p>
