<div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> I got to see one of my heros give what was unarguably the best talk I&#8217;ve ever seen. I feasted on Will Wright&#8217;s every word, and if you watch the video (<a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/video/movie_window.2007.php?dir=2007_trailers&amp;id=1099">1</a> <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/video/movie_window.2007.php?dir=2007_trailers&amp;id=1100">2</a> <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/video/movie_window.2007.php?dir=2007_trailers&amp;id=1101">3</a>) of his talk, I think you might be able to understand why I rank it so high. Of course, I&#8217;ve always ranked Will&#8217;s work highly.</p>
<p>I can thank Will Wright for sparking my interest in computers more so than any other individual. We had some sort of <a href="http://www.apple2clones.com/?q=node/view/107">Apple II clone</a> in my house as a kid, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a> and the like were fun, but I really didn&#8217;t get into computers until the original <a href="http://simcity.ea.com/play/simcity_classic.php">Sim City</a> came out.</p>
<p>I spent a month during the summer between junior high and high school working for my dad so I could earn the money to buy the game, and spent the rest of the summer begging my mom for some computing time. My mom was writing a book at the time, so play time was sparse.</p>
<p>The next summer I worked hard manual labor for the entire summer break so that I could earn enough money to buy my own computer. My dedication was impressive, and I kept myself going by reading reviews about the RPGs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_6">Ultima 6</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_7">Ultima 7</a>. Ultima 7 had me especially drooling because it had simulated weather patterns. I was thrilled with the idea that at any moment while exploring this land that it could start snowing. At the end of the summer I had $2400 saved up (amazing what $5 an hour will get you as a teen).</p>
<p>My dad and I went to a computer show underneath the Anaheim stadium, bought a 386-33 with 2MB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a 85MB hard drive. I&#8217;m pretty sure he had to match my dollars, because at the time this was a top of the line machine.</p>
<p>I savored Ultima 6 and 7 for a few months until I discovered the modem. Within a year of buying my first computer, I had set up a <span class="caps">BBS</span> in my bedroom, and had hooked into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidonet">Fidonet</a>, effectively putting me on the Internet in 1991. I had several hundred local <span class="caps">BBS</span> members. We traded files, swapped stories, and played games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewars_2002">TradeWars 2002</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barren_Realms_Elite"><span class="caps">BRE</span></a> along with a multitude of other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS_door"><span class="caps">BBS</span> door games</a>. It was a sublime period in my life, and when I look back on it, it&#8217;s nearly shocking to think that some of the player to player interaction and community building aspects were stronger then, even with the limitations, than a lot of multiplayer games have now.</p>
<p>Within those first few years of owning a computer I knew, without question, that I wanted to do two things as a career and two things only: build communities, and build games. I&#8217;ve spent time doing both of those things in the past 12 years, but rarely both at the same time &#8211; I was most recently the community manager for Values of N, and before that built and ran <a href="http://llor.nu">llor.nu</a>.</p>
<p>And now that <a href="http://valuesofn.com">Values of N</a> has announced <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">its second product</a>, I intend to reorient myself with the original path I set out for so long ago. I&#8217;ve left Values of N &#8211; no bridges were burned and I wish Rael and crew the best the of luck. I learned an incredible amount about true entrepreneurism and how everything you do matters in a small startup and will use the lessons liberally moving forward.</p>
<p>I need to do some housekeeping first, but within a few months I&#8217;ll be putting my focus back on building clever games on the web and building real communities around them. Will&#8217;s talk didn&#8217;t make the decision for me, but the seed he planted certainly helped remind me of what I enjoy doing: uniting and enabling people to have fun.</p>
