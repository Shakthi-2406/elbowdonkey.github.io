  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did some research on the quantity of spam I get, and the numbers are staggering, at least for me and my four or five addresses.</p>
<p>If I were getting a penny for every piece of spam directed towards my mail server (so, all spam, regardless of the mailbox and whether or not I automatically send it to spam folder before it gets to my inbox) I&#8217;d be making an extra $480 per month. On average, my server receives <strong>1,600</strong> <p>peices of spam a day. Completely unbelievable.</p><br />
<p>Perhaps if I took greater measures towards blocking the spam, I&#8217;d have less, and perhaps if I changed email addresses more often, and kept them more private I&#8217;d get less, but that&#8217;s always a pain.</p><br />
<p>What drives me&nbsp;to near insanity is all of the virus emails I&#8217;m getting (which I included in the above figures). In the time it took me to write this <u>sentence</u>, I&#8217;ve received <strong>5</strong> emails with infected attachments. I need to do something pretty quickly before my hard drive fills up. Luckily I check my mail through a web interface, so there&#8217;s no Outlook security issues, but still, insane. Luckily my mail server has tight integration with a Virus scanner, and sterilizes the files, otherwise I&#8217;d be a basket case.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ve seen news stories of people who have sued spammers and won, collecting small chunks of dough here and there. If I were good at that, I could make a living doing it. What a strange relationship I&#8217;d then have with spammers. I&#8217;d be encouraged to put my email addresses in high traffic situations, and it would sort of be like going fishing.</p><br />
<p>Sigh.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Michael, that green car is related to some type of crime, we need to call the police and have them come check it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrie&#8217;s said this at least a few times. She has an intuition about things sometimes.</p>
<p>Last night at around 1:15am, something was going down outside our apartment windows. Sheriffs&#8217; radios were crackling with the stereotypical nasal voice of the dispatcher. Radio beeps and blips. Right as I was waking up I was hearing &#8220;He could have stashed it over there, between those bushes&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;One guy went running&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I peeked out the window, and there was a patrol car, engine running, right below my window. I tried going back to sleep, but heard another patrol car pull up, and heard what sounded like the loading of a clip into a gun. This was a bit unsettling. I didn&#8217;t think that being on the third floor would help if a gunfight were to break out. And, I knew that if a gun went off, I&#8217;d have a much harder time sleeping after the event. There would be news vans to hover around in hopes of making it on the news. Can&#8217;t sleep at a time like that.</p>
<p>Over an hour later, the sheriffs were still there, but they were making noise again. I looked out again, and they were shining flashlights into the lime green Honda Prelude that&#8217;s been sitting outside our window for the last month, not having moved an inch. They were calling the plates in on the radio, and arguing with some man. The engine noise drowned out&nbsp;most conversation, but I did catch &#8220;&#8230;well then you&#8217;ll go to jail&#8230;.&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;we are prepared to take you in&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning, the car is still there. I lost several hours of sleep, and&nbsp;I was only treated to a watered down version of the most mild stuff you&#8217;d see on Cops. No screaming, not kicking, no arrests as far as I know. There was a lady who went down, and had to ask a sheriff to move his car so she could go to work at 2:30am (another mystery).</p>
<p>At around 3:00am, it seemed the law enforcement officials were finished, and left. All was quiet again. I was left thinking to never again mistrust Carrie&#8217;s intuition. If we had called during the day, I might have slept better last night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some mysteries in life can never be explained. Some, you&#8217;d like to leave unexplained to prolong the incomprehensible impossibility of the mystery.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the phenomenom I call sound portals. A stupid name for a greatly confusing natural (or unnatural) condition. I&#8217;d officialized the name before coming up with something more flashy like Condensed Aural Tube of Portability.</p>
<p>I had my own office on one side of the building, and a coworker, Tony,&nbsp;had an office on the opposite far end of the building. The distance was about twenty to thirty yards, and between our offices were some cubes, and some other corners and a pillar here and there. It wasn&#8217;t exactly a straight line between our office doors as there were obstacles in between.</p>
<p>When Tony would play music over his desktop&nbsp;speakers, I could hear every note as if I were wearing headphones. After mentioning to him that he might want to keep the peace by keeping the volume down, he was confused. He invited me to his office and played the music at the volume level he was listening to his music at. It wasn&#8217;t loud at all, in fact, it was lower than what I would have considered &#8220;safe&#8221; in an office environment. Zoiks!</p>
<p>It turns out that I could hear more than just that. Mouse clicks, phone conversations, paper shuffling. Pretty amazing. Between our offices there was a sound portal. Some strange configuration of physical space that encouraged this strange behavior. We&#8217;d forgone phone conversations, as we would carry on conversations by just speaking at a normal volume, as if we were in the same room.</p>
<p>Now, at my apartment in Oregon, it has happened again.</p>
<p>I woke up the other night thinking there were several people in my room carrying on a conversation about overdue bills. As I shook the sleep away and began to suspect it was a dream, the realizations that the conversations were indeed very real hit, and&nbsp;my heart took a jump. There were three possibilities: 1.) someone was discussing late fees on the credit card, in my room 2.) ghosts 3.) sound portal.</p>
<p>It turns out the conversation comes from an apartment below me, and the sound goes around a corner somewhere. A tricky feat I&#8217;d guess, but I&#8217;ve given up on thinking sound is simple and incapable of tricky feats.</p>
<p>Just in case, I now make sure to be quiet in my room, just in case it works both ways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072225564/michaelbuffin-20" target="_blank"><img height="140" alt="The Complete Reference" src="/mb/images/0072225564.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" width="113" align="left" border="0" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072225564/michaelbuffin-20" target="_self">ColdFusion MX: The Complete Reference</a><br />Yet another excellent book project that I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be a part of, ColdFusion MX : The Complete Reference covers all the new and fancy stuff in the newest version of ColdFusion. If you&#8217;re planning to migrate previous ColdFusion installations to <span class="caps">CFMX</span>, this a great book to have. If you&#8217;re skeptical of the hype surrounding <span class="caps">CFMX</span>, this book will convince you that the hype isn&#8217;t unwarranted.</p>
<p>A lot of readers of my previous CF book have asked if I&#8217;m doing my own <span class="caps">CFMX</span> book. The short answer is no, but it&#8217;s not because of a lack of desire.</p>
<p>Several months ago I was given the offer to do a <span class="caps">CFMX</span> book, and I began to build the outline. Very shortly after starting I found out I was going to be a father. Knowing the level of work required to write a book would cut into preparing for a new child, I turned the offer down.<br />
Not too long after turning it down, reality set in, and my wife and I both agreed that doing the book would be beneficial, but I was still concerned about the work load, so I came up with an idea.<br />
<a href="http://www.ekosm.com" target="_self">Erik</a> did a <b>fantastic</b> job tech editing my previous book. So much so that I knew without a doubt that he was just as capable as, if not more, than me at writing a book. I thought that a team approach would work well to writing the book, and I decided that Erik, as well as another very talented programmer, <a href="http://www.cephas.net" target="_self">Aaron Johnson</a>, and myself, would be able to write an excellent book on ColdFusion MX.<br />
The deal was pitched to the publishers, they liked the idea, we worked out the details, and were ready to start when we received some bad news. The project wasn&#8217;t going to move forward, at no fault of our own. We were all a bit bummed because we were excited about the project. We considered pitching it to other publishers, but the pressures of life, at least on my part, took over and life moved on.<br />
In hindsight, I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t take on the project. My year so far has been pretty chaotic, and juggling a book project (or even a third of a book project) would have been very difficult, if not impossible.<br />
Maybe if things settle down a bit, we&#8217;ll try to collaborate on the project and self publish it, but I&#8217;m sure the lack of a publisher pushing and motivating us will be a disadvantage. Lack of distribution, marketing, and experience certainly wouldn&#8217;t help either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to keep a list of people talking about how Maxim ripped off Stinkfactor here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blahstuff.com/common/single.asp?xml=2002_07_07_blahblog_arch.xml&amp;id=85236010" target="_self">blahstuff.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.ekosm.com/blog/2002-07.htm#1110011" target="_self">ekosm.com</a><br /><a href="http://cykosez.blogspot.com/" target="_self">nathan</a></p>
<p>Yes, the list is small (microscopic)&nbsp;now, but hopefully it will grow. Also, people have been telling me that they&#8217;re using the <a href="http://www.maximonline.com/stupid_fun/dare_maxim/dare.html" target="_self">Dare Maxim</a> <p>page to dare Maxim to be original, or to provide credit. Not a bad idea.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year my friends and I started a site called <a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com/" target="_self">stinkfactor.com</a><p>, where we dared eachother to do stupid things. Up until today, no one has tried to rip off the idea. I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s because we constructed the site well, and have tried to have involvment from our readers. The concept of the site alone is pretty unique, and copies of that concept are pretty easy to spot.</p><br />
<p><a href="http://www.ekosm.com/blog/2002-07.htm#1110011" target="_self">Erik</a> has a good write up on how we have discovered our first rip off. I suggest you read it.</p><br />
<p><a href="http://www.maximonline.com/stupid_fun/dare_maxim/" target="_self">Maxim</a> magazine copied our idea, without the slightest bit of credit. It&#8217;s obvious they&#8217;ve seen stinkfactor as the format is pretty similar despite the differences in the look of the site. Heck, they have their own &#8220;Cinnamon Challenge&#8221;.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of drumming up support from the stinkfactor viewers, but also from the blogging community to talk about this ripoff, enough so that Maxim says something about it. Stinkfactor owes it&#8217;s initial success to the blogging communities, and I&#8217;d bet there would be those out there willing to drop the editor a note mentioning that they snaked us.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ll post an email address soon.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have this problem. Offline, away from computers, I&#8217;ve been very uncreative. I&#8217;m not playing the guitar as much, I haven&#8217;t painted a new illustration in months. Even my handwriting is getting bad.</p>
<p>Maybe this idea I&#8217;m about to suggest is as common to some as tube socks and butter, but to me, it&#8217;s an epiphany. An explanation&nbsp;for my, as of late,&nbsp;code filled, technobabblized head. You see, I get crazy and frustrated when I don&#8217;t feel like I can get the creative juices flowing. Crazy enough to pace, like in cartoons.</p>
<p>Being stuck in a creativity devoid hole is like one of those dreams where Hulk Hogan is chasing you with his friends The Iron Shiek and Rowdy Roddy Piper, and they&#8217;re trying to get you in a head lock. You try and try, but your legs won&#8217;t move. That&#8217;s right, you are petrified. Planted. As mobile as a tree stump.&nbsp;You&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>I think there is a direct correlation with a) creativity and b) economic downturn. <span class="caps">ZOW</span>! Epiphany. That&#8217;s it. I understand now, no need to paint the horse red. Pencils down, I get it. Because I&#8217;m worried about maintaing or getting a job, I don&#8217;t have time for the foo foo artsy fartsy stuff. I have to focus on what I&#8217;m good at, which right now is building web applications and sharing my knowledge of said activity.</p>
<p>And now I can sleep at night, knowing this. No need to worry. When I can purchase the Rolls to compliment the Ferrari parked at my ocean front home in St Thomas, I will return to painting <a href="/illustrations/bill_m.jpg" target="_self">meat</a> <p>pictures.</p><br />
<p>And I have a killer cold going on, in the middle of freakin&#8217; July, in the mid 80&#8217;s for crying out loud. Who made up <em>that</em> junk?</p></p>
