  <div class="entry-content"><p>I (meaning all of us (meaning humanity)) have a mouse problem. The evidence of the mouse is clear. Small, black, crescent like droppings left in places for us to discover at moments where we&#8217;d simply love to not have the problem. There have been two confirmed sightings, although if we could will ourselves to blink less, we might catch the mouse tempting to break the sound barrier more often as it travelled from one hiding spot to another.</p>
<p>As in all cases of pestulence, my duty was clear. Destroy the intruder. I&#8217;m a unifier with humans, but if you&#8217;re not a human, you live in my home, you&#8217;re not a pet, and you break the rule (announcing your existance) it&#8217;s my intrinsic duty to evaporate you. There are no loopholes, no conditions. The rule is as fixed and solid as my preference for comfortable shoes.</p>
<p>Sunday night I set two clever traps below the stove, a favorite place for The Intruder. Small grey boxes, baited with half a Fun Size Snickers bar in each. On one end, a trap door. Off center, on the bottom of the trap, a ridge to act as a fulcrum. When a mouse enters to consume the bounty, his weight on the box floor invokes the simplest of machines &#8211; the lever. The lever is used to disrupt the position of the trap door, which swings down as violently and forcibly as gravity will allow (which to a mouse, must be utterly terrifying, or at least I can hope).</p>
<p>The position of the second most simple machine, the axle, is exploited to the fullest advantage of the trap door, prohibiting the mouse from escaping his new home. Rather than snapping the neck of the mouse, the trap simply confines him. No crawling off to die a cowardly death in the walls. No shrinking to death from ingesting poison. Just pure and simple containment.</p>
<p>Monday morning I checked the traps. One had been tripped, the other open. This was nothing to be excited about, the traps were quite sensitive, and would be closed often in the mornings after setting them. I once set up my digital video camera with night vision to record to my computer all night. Upon review of the footage, the traps were never approached by rodent, nor did they close. The trap closings remain a mystery.</p>
<p>I lifted the trap as I did other mornings, noticed it was too light to contain a critter, opened, knowing it would be empty. The cute mouse that poked his head out was very confusing. I wasn&#8217;t sure exactly what was happening as it jumped out, back under the stove, where it hit me. I had caught him, and he had just escaped. &#8220;<span class="caps">FOOL</span>!&#8221; I yelled, at myself more than the mouse. The mouse acknowledged me for a moment, and as he did, I considered pounding him with my fist to regain my dignity. But as I thought of the mess I&#8217;d have to clean, the mouse retreated into the confines of the stove, where I heard him settling into bed for the day, charging up for another night of intrusion.</p>
<p>And so, the mouse problem goes on, and now that I&#8217;ve seen the enemy with his mask of cuteness, his removal from my domain is simply a matter of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m in a particularly covetous mood today. My life is not complete without the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archos.com/products/prw_500570.html">AV380 Video Recorder</a> &#8211; an 80G harddrive with a screen. This would be a great thing to have as part of my digital photography kit. I could offload files to the drive, and get a better look at my images to see if my exposure settings were working as intended. The fact that it can play movies and MP3&#8217;s is frosting on the cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mytoolstore.com/sherline/millin06.html">Sherline Deluxe 8-direction Milling Machine, <span class="caps">CNC</span> Ready</a> &#8211; Really, no one should be deprived of such a powerful machine. If I had one of these, I&#8217;d be able to create just about any gizmo I wanted, including the rarely mentioned &#8220;Shoes with 1 million feet&#8221; device. This is a must have.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.liquitex.com/products/paintmedvisartcol1.cfm">Liquitex Medium Viscosity Artist Colors</a> &#8211; If I could only pick five colors, they would be Cadmium Yellow Deep Hue (#163), Cerulean Blue (#164), Cadmium Red Medium (#154), Mars Black (#276), and Titanium White (#432). The bigger the bottle the better. These paints in these colors produce an unlimited range of colors in a very specific pallete that I&#8217;m quite fond of. Also enjoyed in large quantities, <a href="http://www.liquitex.com/products/surfprepgesso.cfm">Liquitex Gesso</a>. Perfect for prepping any surface for fine illustrations. Avoid Liquitex&#8217;s <span class="caps">BASIC</span> brand. It&#8217;s made of water, dog slobber, and a smigden of pigment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuels.com/reuels/page265.html">Windsor Newton University Brushes</a> &#8211; Since we&#8217;re talking illustrations, these brushes are the ones for me. Relatively cheap, smooth, white, synthetic bristles that don&#8217;t fall out, and create any kind of line I want. I prefer Flat, Bright, and Round brushes of any size. Smaller Round brushes  have legs, and are always in short supply. The key to spotting them in the wild &#8211; white bristles, red handles. The red handles encourage feelings of panic and aggression, which is exactly the feeling I try to portray in my work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roombavac.com/buyroomba/defaultB.asp">Roomba Robotic Floorvac</a> &#8211; Robots will enslave humans eventually, but before they do, I&#8217;m going to take advantage of their stupidity while I still can. This one will suck dirt out of my carpets. Now that I own more carpet than I ever have, I&#8217;m thinking one of these would do well under my command.</p>
<p>Have I missed anything?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been doing some thinking after having done some research. Apparently, Google thinks that I am the expert on sweat (<a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/google.cfm">check out the rough logs for yourself</a>). Yep, sweat. I get more referers from Google reference sweaty topics than anything else. Sweaty Britney Spears, sweaty heads, sweaty hands, sweaty windows, sweaty pits, sweaty neck. I&#8217;m the king of sweat.<br />
I&#8217;ve decided that because Google says so, I&#8217;m now the King of Sweat. If you&#8217;re interested in sweat (I know you are, otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be here) then you should know right up front that I sweat profusely. It dribbles from my face regardless of the air temperature, and practically showers out of my pits. I wear terry cloth robes, and frequently change them. I sit in a wading pool to avoid flooding the house. My sweat is prevelant, and that&#8217;s what makes me the king of sweat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a whim, Carrie and I decided to drive to Ikea. The nearest one is three hours away. I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;ll ever be doing that again. Given the choice of no furniture versus spending three hours in the car, three hours chasing after Leah, then three hours in the car again, I&#8217;ll take the no furniture.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t all fruitless &#8211; we secured a new breakfast nook table to replace our current ultra small one, some extra chairs for the upcoming Thanksgiving crowd, and a futon for the guest room. And I had Blue Jell-O in the Ikea cafeteria, which was a special treat.<br />
All parcels were wrapped obsessively in a tarp in the back of my truck for the trip home. Driving north from Portland to Seattle, we drove through some of the heaviest rain I&#8217;ve ever been in, and I wasn&#8217;t about to have my newly secured goods tainted by water. On the trip up we saw at least four rainbows, downed powerlines, and a derailed freight train. On the trip back, with water tight cargo, just a bit of rain, and a crew of men investigating the derailment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had an idea for a little application that I think would be cool. OS X has a program called Stickies that mimics real life Post It notes. As far as I know, that&#8217;s basically all it does. Retains sticky yellow notes.</p>
<p>I think it would be clever if I could stick those stickies to an application window. I thought the easiest approach, at least for Windows, would be to have them show up as a little yellow icon in the title bar of the application. They would be linked with that window for either the life of the window, or for the life of the application, depending on how you wanted it. Don&#8217;t want to link the sticky to an application window? Fine, it behaves just like a regular, independant sticky.</p>
<p>I often open dozens of windows with the intention of coming back to some later on, and I think this would be helpful for me to remind myself of my thought process at the time I opened the window.</p>
<p>And perhaps more powerful might be if a Stickies like program could squirrel away some metadata about what you routinely put in. So if I opened up a few tabs in my web browser for later viewing and added some notes about why I wanted to see them in the first place, it&#8217;d be cool if the app stored all of those notes and URLs in a single place for analysis later. Or if I put simple todo items on the Sticky, have it so I could go and see a master list, organized by the Sticky I created. I think that&#8217;d be a super useful app stuff.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle, and maker-or-breaker of this nice little tool? The interface. It would have to be nice looking, unobtrusive, but easy to get to at the same time. Docking a sticky to the application window of choice would need to be super easy, and fast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.claytonbrothers.com/">Clayton Brothers</a> have a new book coming out with a bunch of their newer and some older stuff. Site pops up into it&#8217;s own frame (can&#8217;t stand that) but the illustrations are good.<br />
A few years ago I took an illustration class taught by the brothers, and had a great time. Now that I have a garage, I&#8217;m getting the serious itch to start illustrating again. Once the skills are exercised a bit more, I think we&#8217;ll start painting bits and pieces in Leah&#8217;s room.<br />
I remember when I first started dating Carrie she showed me the closet of her room where she grew up, and the walls were covered with illustrations that no one knew about. It was like finding cave paintings, or some other mysterious artefact, forgotten and lost.<br />
The Clayton brothers talked about how when they were kids, their dad would encourage them to paint and draw on anything, including the walls. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m pretty willing to encourage myself (within reason of course, I&#8217;m not sure what guests would think if they saw my illustrations painted on the living room walls). When it comes to pursuing creative activity, I&#8217;m not going to put up too many boundaries for my kids. I love the Royal Tennebaums movie, and one reason is that I think I&#8217;m drawn to the kind of encouragement of talents that the family in the movie displayed. Painting on the walls, starting up businesses, plenty of books, paintings, stuffed boars, tents in the house. It&#8217;s what I want my home to be like. No pursuit is discouraged.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Come to find out, creating new folders in Windows is a real pain in the neck. There&#8217;s no official keyboard shortcut, and using the mouse to create them is painful. I did find out that if you hit Alt-F then the Enter key twice, you end up with a New Folder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to try some techniques to keep myself organized on my computer. The first among what I hope are many techniques is to use the computer&#8217;s file system to organize files according to subject. At first, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll automatically know what kind of hierarchy I&#8217;ll have, but it will probably become obvious pretty quickly. I should be able to drag just about anything to these folders, include URLs from IE or Mozilla, email messages, documents from email or the current file system, and probably more that I haven&#8217;t thought of.<br />
Using the file system rather than some kind of application means that I can easily move the root folder to another computer or operating system. I think that eventually I might move the entire thing to a removable solid state drive (depends on how big this thing gets), which makes it application and computer independant<br />
Going this way, however, means I can&#8217;t truly put something into two categories (if file folders are category based). I can put one file in a folder, and shortcut or symlink to another, but there is always one file as the root. In other words, there&#8217;s a bit of overhead to multiple categories for single entities of information that I&#8217;m not willing to deal with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi. My name is Michael, and I&#8217;m woefully disorganized. I have socks mixed in with my butter knives, and lip balm in my light sockets (or maybe not, but that has a nice ring to it [note to self: use as childrens&#8217; book title]). In my pocket, I have a 2 pent piece from England, a Danish coin, a Euro, $0.85, a mint, a guitar pick, a wingnut, and a screw that doesn&#8217;t match the nut. I&#8217;ve been transferring these items from dirty pants pockets to clean pants pockets every morning. I have no idea how any of them got there to begin with. My level of disorganization outside of work is frightening.</p>
<p>But my mind isn&#8217;t disorganized. I tidily file away my current bank balance, status and to do items on over four software projects outside of work and two major ones at work, important dates like birthdays and anniversaries, future ideas, political view points, likes and dislikes, and most importantly, thousands of informative, but ultimately useless facts collected from years of drinking Snapple.</p>
<p>How do I make my life neat and tidy? And this includes my own computer, where all files deemed important go into a single folder. No URLs ever get bookmarked, and items pile up on the desktop biologically. I backup items to zip files that I never open again, and they tag along from hard drive to hard drive much like my pocket flotsam (careful).</p>
<p>And does a neat and tidy life = higher productivity/creativity/sanity or do I not know what I&#8217;m asking for? Will I become obsessed with right angles and evenly spaced french fries? Will I buy a label maker and put an L on my left shoe and an R on my right? Will I always button the top button of my shirts, even when not wearing a tie? Will I obsessively insist on bringing toilet paper everywhere I go, just in case?</p>
<p>This introspection all started when working on a development project this weekend, and I was releasing an entire new version of the project. It was painful knowing that I had no formalized version control system and no way of keeping track of major differences in text files except that I had saved the old version and called the folder <i>projectname_old</i>. Isn&#8217;t that lame? I know better than this, but when I&#8217;m in a hurry and it&#8217;s my own personal project, I take shortcuts eventhough I know that will come back to bite me.</p>
<p>How do <i>you</i> stay organized, in general or even specifically?</p>
