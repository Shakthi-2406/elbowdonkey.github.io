  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s something about seeing people get hit in the head by flying objects that really tickles my funny bone. Non-lethal/no damage collisions mind you. Tennis balls, baseballs, whatever.</p>
<p>My brother Jason (who reads this and might not be pleased with my telling this story) is the king of getting hit in the head. I think a lot of why I think its so funny is because of the following two stories:</p>
<p>Jason and I as kids in the backyard. I was perhaps ten or eleven, Jason always two years older. For some long forgotten reason, Jason is standing on a picnic table. For another long forgotten reason, I decide to throw a baseball straight up. Or what I think&nbsp;is straight up. It turns out I have somewhat of an arc in my throw, enough so that the baseball hits Jason directly on top of the head.</p>
<p>Now, even then, this was supremely funny to me. But Jason ices the cake. Instead of simply collapsing, Jason decides to jump (I can hardly type remembering this), and its no simple hop. Jason decides to jump out from the center of the table, doing barrel rolls. Like a crocodile in a death spin, Jason clutching the top of his head, cursing.</p>
<p>I think I got a serious pounding for that. Well worth it.</p>
<p>The second story. We&#8217;re teenagers, and desperately want a launch ramp for riding our skateboards on. Something about the design of our ramp is flawed and Jason has set out to fix it. For what must have been a very good reason, Jason is swinging the hammer at a two by four from below. So the hammer is swinging towards him, rather than the traditional away from him. I notice about three of these swings, and right as I&#8217;m about to make a stupid comment, he misses the two by four, and the hammer nails him right in the center of his forehead.</p>
<p>Obviously, you shouldn&#8217;t laugh at someone in a situation like this. But I wasn&#8217;t told about that rule, and had a good laugh anyhow. Jason had a swelled purple friend on his forehead for at least a day or more.</p>
<p>So what brings these stories to mind? </p>
<p>As I was driving back to work from lunch, I saw the most unique and singular incident. Picture a man walking his dog (the dog wearing a yellow rain slicker, as is the fashion amongst Oregonian canines). Out of nowhere, a yellow object at high speed meets the owners head. Right smack dab on the middle of his head. The object bounces a good twenty feet or so straight up, and (believe it) comes right back down on his dog&#8217;s head. As the man his clutching his head in disbelief, the dog leash is loose, and the dog is doing laps around his owner in a frenzy of confusion. I stopped, the guy was fine, the dog was fine. The object, a yellow golf ball, was fine, and we had no idea where it came from, but damn it was funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found out about <a href="http://andrew.diaryland.com" target="_self">Andrew</a><p>&nbsp;through <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org" target="_self">Matt</a>&nbsp;and spent a good time laughing. Longing for a pet miniature horse, swallowing flys, unzipped flys, getting sick from hot dogs &#8211; it&#8217;s all an eerie reminder of the things that happen to me that I always say &#8220;there&#8217;s one for the blog&#8221; but never get around to writing.</p><br />
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been on this &#8220;gotta write smart sounding stuff&#8221; kick. I&#8217;m usually trying to convince people I&#8217;m smart, which I guess I don&#8217;t really need to do. First of all, I know I&#8217;m smart, and they probably do also, so why put on the smart guy show. And truth be told, I&#8217;m not as smart as a lot of people. I just catch on quick.</p><br />
<p>So, resolution number twenty-one &#8211; cut the crap. Talk about the time a seagull dropped a burrito on some dude&#8217;s head more often. Reminisce about the beloved Datsun 510. Talk about my heart twisting desire to have a halfpipe of my very own. Talk about the Fry&#8217;s dork who was convinced I&#8217;d lost my tan from being in Oregon too long by just looking at my California drivers license (as if I ever was tan in California).</p><br />
<p>Techie and political talk is fine and good, and I&#8217;ll do more of it, but I need to balance it more with what usually takes center stage in my mind &#8211; monkeys on wiener dogs and things of that nature.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I see the shape of Australia in my food a lot. It drives <a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/carrie" target="">Carrie</a> <p>nuts. Pasta usually represents the shape of Australia the most frequently. I had an apple fritter the other day that not only was a spitting image of the continent, also had the mountain ranges, the Outback, and Sydney harbor.</p><br />
<p>I used to exclaim with great surprise &#8220;Australia!&#8221;, but as the frequency increased, it wasn&#8217;t so exciting any more. It was a normal thing. And Carrie wasn&#8217;t pleased with my lastest manifestation of neuroris.</p><br />
<p>So now, I keep silent, and&nbsp;just eat Perth first, then work my way left towards Brisbane.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Macromedia has released a couple of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/servers/macintosh/" target="">new products</a> <p>that run on OS X, including ColdFusion MX. I always said &#8220;If I could get CF to run on a Mac I might switch over.&#8221; Well, I haven&#8217;t fully switched yet, although Windows is getting uglier and more buggy feeling every day. I still intend to work on both platforms for a couple of reasons, foremost is the fact that I can test web creations on most all of the popular browsers and platforms, but also, just having a healthy dose of each platform daily gives me a broader understanding of software design, and what works well and what doesn&#8217;t.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not what you&#8217;d call a fan of Penn &amp; Teller, only because I&#8217;ve just never paid much attention to them. But I ran across a <a href="http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penniphile/federalvip.html" target="_self">story</a> <p>written by Penn about airport security that I think is interesting.</p><br />
<p>I liked this line by Penn: <em>&#8220;&#8230;freedom is kind of a hobby with me, and I have disposable income that I&#8217;ll spend to find out how to get people more of it.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>In the story, he recounts how a security guard was groping a little too close to Penn&#8217;s groin, at which Penn said (in my words) &#8220;Hey, you need to ask before groping&#8221;, at which the guard said something like &#8220;Once you cross that security line, I can do whatever I want.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>I agree with the getting permission part. If Penn said &#8220;no sir, no groin groping please&#8221;, the security guard could and should have said &#8220;Well then, no flight for you then, get lost.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I think Penn is just a big stinker, making noise for the sake of noise, or if he was actually being effective&nbsp;at increasing my freedom. I haven&#8217;t been groped at the airport, although I&#8217;ve been searched a lot. I take it for what it is. By tolerating a momentary loss of freedom, my chances of a safe flight are probably increased. Would I react as Penn did if someone was too aggressive? Probably.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=390" target="_self"><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I should have mentioned this earlier, but my wife <a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/carrie" target="">Carrie</a> <p>is blogging again.</p><br />
<p>If I were less tired this morning, I&#8217;d say something special about how husband/wife blogs might give insight into married life. But I&#8217;m too tired. I fell asleep and woke up at least sixteen times last night. My legs weren&#8217;t comfortable. They felt like kicking things.</p><br />
<p>I did come up with a semi-lucid idea this morning though (or was that last night?). Because I have this problem of drinking rancid milk or not getting my hair cut, I&#8217;ve decided to build a calculator section on this site that will use kick ass information design techniques to save me from the hair and the milk. I&#8217;m sure I can use it for other things too. It could remind me to pay my bills, or give someone a monthly compliment. It&#8217;s going to be stupendous.</p><br />
<p>Also, speaking of site additions, I&#8217;ve been working feverishly at developing a standards compliant layout for the site, as well as a layout that is accessible to audio browsers. </p><br />
<p>My motivation? It&#8217;s simple. I sat down at my computer, then closed my eyes, and tried performing even the easiest of computing tasks. For me, it was impossible. If I had a screen reader, perhaps I could do more than nothing. Designing my site to work well with audio browsers is easy to do with <span class="caps">CSS</span> and some design techniques. The amount of effort put in is dwarfed by the value it can provide to just a single person.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I desired more width on the site, and decided the quick way would be to simply add on a few pixels to the right column. This way I could fit two columns of navigation, giving me more room to add the many interesting things I don&#8217;t currently have linked up.</p>
<p>But then I started playing with the style sheet, because the <a href="?testStyle=newberg.css" target="">old blue</a> <p>color was bugging out my eyes. But then I began to realize that I wasn&#8217;t making very good use of <span class="caps">CSS</span> and standards, and began setting out to fix that. Now it&#8217;s stuck halfway between.</p><br />
<p>My ultimate goal is to have the site use strict <span class="caps">XHTML</span> with <span class="caps">CSS</span> controlling the presentation. I&#8217;m also trying to make it pretty accessible, although I have no tools other than a few text browsers to approximate how it will end up looking/sounding. So far, the text browsers handle it very well, displaying nicely formatted blog entries, following by the site navigation, which is the way I like it.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=385" target=""><br />
