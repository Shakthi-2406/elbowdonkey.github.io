  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first time I owned TiVo I was in a total frenzy because the 2002 Winter Olympics started that day and I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to watch the opening ceremonies, let alone curling and whatever you call that sport where you ski and shoot at things.</p>
<p>So I went to Circuit City, bought a plain old TiVo, took it home, hooked it up to my satellite reciever, and grimaced with each change of the channel. It was awful. It literally took a few seconds to switch channels. It was frustration in it&#8217;s most pure form. Sure all the pausing of live broadcasts and stuff was fun, but it was painful to say the least.</p>
<p>So, after recording, then watching the opening ceremonies on fast forward, I took the TiVo back. Circuit City wasn&#8217;t happy at all. The guy wasn&#8217;t mad so much because I was bringing something back; he was mad because I didn&#8217;t like my TiVo.</p>
<p>I wanted an integrated system &#8211; the TiVo required some serial cable hookup mumbo jumbo which probably made it so nasty slow. I wanted my receiver and <span class="caps">PVR</span> stuff in one unit, and that unit was the UltimateTV box. That was like heaven compared to TiVo, required no phone line and didn&#8217;t cost any extra (well, it did, but I never did sign up and all things worked just fine). The menus were great, the channel switching was fast, and best of all, I could record two shows at once, even while watching previously recorded stuff. And it had a 30 second skip button, which made getting through commercials accurate and fast.</p>
<p>So now, in Oregon, we have no satellite reception. But we were still starving for the ability to pause TV and record stuff easily. So we got a TiVo again, this time, the Series 2. It works great because it just hooks into our free cable feed. I miss the 30 second skip button, but overall I&#8217;m happy to have more control over TV again.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if anyone wants to buy the UltimateTV unit, I wouldn&#8217;t mind selling it. Just toss in your current DirectTV smart card and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a project at Xerox where half the team is in the UK. That half of the team is currently here in the US, and as is tradition, it&#8217;s my duty to take advantage of the language/cultural differences. It helps build team morale, and keeps my credibility in top notch. There&#8217;s a level of trust the UK developers put in their US team. If they point at some kind of food, or a road sign, and ask what it is or what it means, they&#8217;re ready to believe what you have to say.</p>
<p>Gavin doesn&#8217;t trust me any more. I told him there was a robot roaming the halls outside of the room we&#8217;re all working in (extreme programming, dude) and the next time he heard it coming, he was nearly out the door before he realized I was &#8220;taking a piss&#8221; (hardcore British slang for pulling a leg). It wasn&#8217;t a robot afterall, but a guy driving an electric cart.</p>
<p>The thing is, Gavin is so trusting, even when he&#8217;s shook his fists in rages of mistrust dozens of times now, exclaiming &#8220;I knew it, I can&#8217;t trust you for a second!&#8221; Everytime I do it, I feel bad, but really &#8211; the moment when he&#8217;s convinced there&#8217;s a robot outside or that Tater Tots are actually called Puffy Lumps is a moment <strong>so</strong> <p>worth whatever guilt follows.</p><br />
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind some <a href="comments.cfm?id=409" target="">suggestions</a> as to what I can convince Gavin of. If he reads the site, all my plans are dashed, but it&#8217;s a chance I&#8217;m willing to take.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, the full update. Actually, that&#8217;s a total lie, because there a couple of little mini features that I&#8217;ve yet to finish, but this is good enough for now. Notice my handy dandy expiration dates indicator. No more talk of drink rancid milk for me, I have the bad milk indicator.</p>
<p>Also, the past several photos I&#8217;ve taken with my SideKick show up on the left. I take the picture with my phone, email them to a special email address, and a ColdFusion component checks the email for new pics. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>
<p>Also in the update, I put a <em>n</em> <p>amount of comments indicator. That&#8217;ll help remind me that people do indeed make comments. The search engine has been updated to be a little more accurate as well as user friendly. And the links section now pulls link feeds from selected MoveableType users who decide to syndicate their links.</p><br />
<p>And they layout &#8211; it&#8217;s more accessable, closer to the <span class="caps">XHTML</span> spec than the last (although still sloppy) and stretches to fit any browserwidth.</p><br />
<p>What&#8217;s to come? Product reviews, my illustration/photography/video expirements, site case studies and other web toys.</p><br />
<p>Tell me what you think, and tell me if you find any bugs or browser issues.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten over how much it rains in Oregon. Rain is a constant in Oregon like afternoon sunshine is a constant in Southern California. So walking the ten minutes to work in the morning isn&#8217;t such a big deal, even when the rain is going sideways and your umbrella is doing more to lift you off the ground than it is to keep you dry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The past couple of times walking to and from work, I&#8217;ve discovered a phenomenon that I&#8217;m not sure if I should be terrified about or enthralled with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I call this scientific event &#8220;Umbrella Lightning&#8221;, or depending on severity &#8220;Time Machine Umbrella&#8221;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I have my umbrella above my head, and walk under the high tension power lines that express their dislike for rain by hissing, buzzing and popping, <strong>lightning plays in my umbrella</strong>. It starts by worming around a spring in the center of the top of the umbrella, then starts crackling and getting more intense until it darts a tendril out to one or two of the spars of the umbrella.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;m not staring up into my umbrella; the discovery was an accident. I heard crackling louder than normal, swung the umbrella down to look up at the powerlines and the noise stopped. I put it back up, heard the noise, and looked up into the umbrella and saw the peculiar show. It scared me enough that I put the umbrella down until I was done walking underneath the lines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I let it happen. I kept the umbrella up to see the lightning. It performed as expected, dancing blue electricity, but this time, it made my face tingle, like pins and needles. This freaked me out, so I swung the umbrella down and stopped the expirement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I tried it again this morning, and there was lightning, but no tingle. As I relay the story, I&#8217;m scared to try it again, but when I get underneath those lines, it&#8217;s hard not to watch the lightning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, am I at risk of having my brains fried? <a href="comments.cfm?id=405">Can you explain what&#8217;s happening?</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just heard my Dad&#8217;s operation went well. I&#8217;ll probably hear from him tonight, but if I don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s probably because he&#8217;s still too groggy or tired.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it&#8217;s time I start eating healthier. I&#8217;m basically a mirror image of my Dad physically, just not as tall. When he was in his twenties, his lung collapsed. When I was in my twenties, my lung collapsed. His was from shaping surf boards without a mask, mine was from falling off a trampoline, or skateboarding, or snowboarding (doctor said it was from a fall, I was falling a lot around that time). But he also said it was likely to also be genetic.</p>
<p>So, even though I hate it now, I&#8217;ve gotta start eating more fish instead of beef. So, for all those who have been begging me to eat sushi, your time of triumph is fast approaching.</p>
