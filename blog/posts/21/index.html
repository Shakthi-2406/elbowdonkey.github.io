  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and the kids and I went to the Tiger premiere at the Apple store tonight to witness the purest and most elusive expression of excitement ever, Apple fans waiting for a new OS, drool bibs in place. A few hundred surprisingly not so geeky looking people were waiting in special roped off areas within the mall as mall patrons stood and watched, seeing a queue and conducting internal struggles as to whether they should ask, or just get in line to see what would happen. They opened the store right as we rolled up in the double stroller, so we joined the devoted.</p>
<p>Two incredibly cheerful Apple employees were letting people in in groups, and giving out fancy cards. Inside the store mad cheers would explode about every three minutes, and Jonas would squirm in his seat worried about the chaos. Before coming, I&#8217;d learned about the cards &#8211; everyone who got a card was bound to win at least an iTunes song, but one lucky fool was going to win a 15&quot; Powerbook, among other good prizes. We got our scratchers, won iTunes, and went straight back out of the packed store. We&#8217;d come back later after eating gyros at the Greek place.</p>
<p>The same synthetically cheerful Apple employee gave me a card on our second visit. I was on a mission to pick up one of the new G5s. This time, the scratcher said something different. I was one of the lucky few to get a 10% discount on my purchase for that night only. Awesome! I didn&#8217;t tell anybody because I don&#8217;t like to illicit mad cheers for having dumb luck. I like to earn it.</p>
<p>But this gift of 10% off was a sudden burden. Having decided that I would get the 2ghz G5 before coming, I was now wondering what it would cost to go half or even whole hog on a faster system. Instead of the 2.7ghz machine being $1000 more than the 2ghz, it would be $700 more. In the end the confusion and noise and people slobbering on all the Apple goods dashed any plans of changing my original plan.</p>
<p>Weird thing is, I got a lot more than 10% off. For some reason, my system rang up, pre-discount, at $1849. The Apple website shows the machine at $1999. I had the girl ringing me up check several times if it was right. I don&#8217;t like to feel like I&#8217;m cheating. She verified it was correct each time, so I stopped trying to give her more money than she wanted to take. I walked out with a few odds and ends and paid about $1700 for a $1999 machine. And I didn&#8217;t pay sales tax either, as the fine state of Oregon doesn&#8217;t believe in sales tax.</p>
<p>And now, I&#8217;m playing with Tiger. I&#8217;m liking the Dashboard already, Safari is crazy fast, and that&#8217;s as far as I&#8217;ve gotten. I made the mistake of skipping the &#8220;transfer settings and applications from another Mac&#8221; step during the Tiger install, and when I went to do it from the util, I realized that I have duplicate user names. So I had to rename the incoming user name, which makes me uncomfortable. Doing the transfer isn&#8217;t that comforting either &#8211; I like the idea of a fresh and clean install of the OS, and I have no idea what the transfer util does. There&#8217;s a huge chance I&#8217;ll not like what it did, and do a full erase and install again, and transfer all of stuff by hand somehow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon Carrie looked out our front window and with extreme confusion breaking up her sentences said &#8220;What the&#8230; someone put&#8230; hey, there are flowers on our porch.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2000/10/carrie_and_i_ca.html">This kind of thing has happened before, over four years ago.</a> But this was still a surprise. Flowers don&#8217;t just show up, and these flowers were different. In a little pot were a few purple flowers that I&#8217;m sure Carrie knows the name of. No frills really, just a regular small potted flower like you&#8217;d get at Home Depot. Stuck into the soil was a &#8220;Care and Feeding&#8221; spike that informed us that a new nursery was opening up locally.</p>
<p>This was, hands down, the best marketing material I&#8217;ve ever received. But I don&#8217;t know why I feel that way exactly &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s because they gave me a free sample of what they sell. Maybe it&#8217;s simply because you can&#8217;t really get mad at flowers. I&#8217;m not sure, but I know that I&#8217;ll probably use this new nursery over Home Depot just because they came up with a clever way of introducing themselves by attacking my neighborhood with flowers.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> April 21<br />
I didn&#8217;t mention who the nursery was last night because the pot was out in the front yard, but because several people have asked: <a href="http://www.als-gardencenter.com/">Al&#8217;s Garden Center</a> (someone please offer to give them a better site). Also, I didn&#8217;t notice this before, but the purple flowers are part of Al&#8217;s corporate identity &#8211; they use the purple flower as a logo, and call themselves &#8220;The Purple People&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still wondering if I&#8217;d be this excited if Oscar Meyer came and put a pack of hot dogs in my refrigerator. I doubt it. I&#8217;m probably mostly excited because of the flowers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Robots have it easy. Seriously. When they want to make an announcement they don&#8217;t need to think, they just say &#8220;MY <span class="caps">BATTERIES</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">FULLY</span> <span class="caps">CHARGED</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="caps">ACTUATOR</span> 8A4B <span class="caps">FUNCTIONING</span> <span class="caps">PROPERLY</span>&#8221; and proceed with whatever they need to do, like welding automobile door frames, emotionless. Me, I rewrite sentences over and over until they sound right so I can state facts but also associate my current emotions with those facts. Screw that, I embrace my inner robot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a super secret special project with <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com">Adaptive Path</a>.</p>
<p>There. Pleasant and efficient robot inspired communication. Fully lacking in emotion and any tasty hints as to what the project is. You don&#8217;t know if it involves robots and laser beams or ponies and birthday parties, or all of those things wrapped into a gift basket with a wedge of British Cheddar. And for now, I&#8217;m fine with that, because like I said, super secret.</p>
<p>Despite the secrecy, I can say I&#8217;m super excited and can&#8217;t wait to say what the project really is. I will leave this one particular hint though: we think <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is pretty hot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are big city noises that, when heard during the day have a nice sound to them in one way or another, but at 3AM are poo for the ears.</p>
<p>1. Glass bottles being dumped from a large metal container into a larger metal container. During the day, as I walk past, sounds kind of neat. I think about how each bottle has its own &#8220;note&#8221; based on the weight of the glass, the shape, its velocity as it moves from one vessel to another. At 3AM it makes me want to peel my skin off.</p>
<p>2. Enormous black man having a furious argument on his cell phone that includes phrases like &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of the haters&#8221; and &#8220;can&#8217;t keep this brother back&#8221; yelled at extreme decibels. The passion and the intimidation factor are super high. Like watching one side of a fantastic boxing match. At 3AM it makes your heart explode and makes you want to hide under a mattress.</p>
<p>3. Colossal explosion sound of completely unknown origins. I love a good, people friendly, explosion. Anything that can shake buildings has my vote in an instant. If, when I was a kid, all authority figures could have some just made a colossal exploding sound, I would have done everything they asked. At 3AM it throws you out of bed and makes you kick like a wild Mustang horse uncontrollably.</p>
<p>4. Screaming ladies, probably hookers. During the day a lady screaming on the street corner about something is someone to respect. Anyone who can escape the clutches of embarrassment in order to further whatever cause they&#8217;re furthering is interesting, and typically looks really funny too and is a good alternative to the black jacketed, dirty jeaned, iPod sporting city folk like myself. At 3AM, you plot the trajectory of your hotel room television to where she is still standing, very clearly screaming &#8220;crocodile arms&#8221; at the top of her lungs which is also attracting more people who enjoy doing things like screaming &#8220;crocodile arms&#8221; as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent some time playing with Google&#8217;s satellite maps and ended up dredging up a bunch of nostalgia. I can see why people are using it to create what are being called <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/memorymaps/pool/">memory maps</a>. When you see the images of where you&#8217;ve been, even from a thousand feet up, it all comes flooding back.</p>
<p>There was the place I lived when I first started working on the Internet, with the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=global+pacific+internet,orange,+ca&amp;ll=33.77928972244263,-117.89188385009766&amp;spn=0.01508474349975586,0.016608238220214844&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">office complex</a> only a few hundred feet away. It was also the first place I&#8217;d ever lived outside of my <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=goldenwest+and+heil,huntington+beach,+ca&amp;ll=33.72086048126221,-118.01100611686707&amp;spn=0.00754237174987793,0.008304119110107422&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">parents&#8217; house</a> and where my car was broken into for the first time. I dragged the screen over to my parents&#8217; house, and then from there to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=brookhurst+and+hamilton,huntington+beach,+ca&amp;ll=33.64893436431885,-117.95859575271606&amp;spn=0.00754237174987793,0.008304119110107422&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">Carrie&#8217;s parents house</a>. Along the way I caught glimpses of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=huntington+beach+library,huntington+beach,+ca&amp;ll=33.70288968086243,-118.00658583641052&amp;spn=0.01508474349975586,0.016608238220214844&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">parks</a> I&#8217;d played in as a kid, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=huntington+beach,ca&amp;ll=33.65568280220032,-118.00401091575623&amp;spn=0.00754237174987793,0.008304119110107422&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">beaches I gone surfing at</a>, and neighborhoods of friends. The maps trigger near video like memories for me that I hadn&#8217;t thought about since perhaps the events actually happened.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s weird for me is that this isn&#8217;t new technology. Like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/04/google-maps-and-user-experience">Jason points out</a>, services that allow you to see satellite images of the ground have been available on the Internet for years, most of them free. Google has done such a good job of designing the user experience that the interface is completely transparent. You don&#8217;t even feel like it&#8217;s there at all. You can just set your zoom level and drag like crazy.</p>
<p>Google maps is simply a sign of things to come. With ideas like <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>, the web as we know it is currently changing more so than it probably ever has since the first graphic showed up. The entire way of thinking about how to make sites that people interact with is changing. The idea of the web page itself is nearing its useful end. With the way Ajax allows you to build nearly stateless applications that happen to be web accessible, everything changes. What it changes into is starting to become apparent, but I think we&#8217;re still trying to figure out where we&#8217;ll end up.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t wait to see what comes next. If I&#8217;m content to drag the map from my <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=sherwood,or&amp;ll=45.35707092285156,-122.85710663815792&amp;spn=0.00754237174987793,0.008304119110107422&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">current house</a> to one of my <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=newberg,or&amp;ll=45.28971076011658,-122.97695517539978&amp;spn=0.00754237174987793,0.008304119110107422&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">favorite parks</a>, I can&#8217;t wait for what&#8217;s next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent an hour wrestling with MySQL on OS X, which is 58 minutes too many. MySQL is a pretty tight program &#8211; it&#8217;s up and running in seconds on Windows. RedHat takes about the same amount of time if you use an <span class="caps">RPM</span>.</p>
<p>And I wish I could say this was the first time something like this has happened. When it comes to simple <span class="caps">GUI</span> apps, installs are fabulous on a Mac. More often than not you just drag a single icon into your Applications folder, or just run the application wherever you feel like it. Uninstalling is basically as easy as dropping the app in the trash (and cleaning out preference files if you&#8217;re picky). Try that with a compiled Linux app like MySQL.</p>
<p><a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> makes things slightly easier (it&#8217;s currently reinstalling MySQL for me in the background) but if you want the latest releases of less popular Linux software, good luck.</p>
<p>Even if I&#8217;m just ignorant and don&#8217;t know how to make things work behind the scenes, I know it could be better. I&#8217;d take Apple more seriously if they were able to apply the Apple touch to this problem. Just make it work, like most everything else works.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not everything goes according to plan. I for one am acutely aware of this, having assumed earlier in life that at this date I&#8217;d be either an architect of buildings, or plan B, a pilot of some sort. Those plans, having been hatched as probably my first attempts at making lifelong plans at some tender age of sixish, didn&#8217;t have much chance when I got my hands on my first computer. Brilliant tools, these computers.</p>
<p>Even as an adult (I still consider myself new at this) with years of planning experience, not everything goes according to plan. The plan a year ago was to focus all of my efforts on Price.com. But check it out, a year later and I&#8217;m moving on. As much as I wanted to make it happen, my heart wasn&#8217;t in it. The same fire I had when starting Price.com wasn&#8217;t there &#8211; I was squeezing the bellows at a fever pitch just to get those same embers to flare up, and in the end they remained stubborn.</p>
<p>Several people I consider good friends are still committed to the project and I admire them and I want them to succeed. And I firmly believe they&#8217;ll do well with or without me. If they don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll eat a frog.</p>
<p>However, despite my lukewarm approach to my last project, I&#8217;m a raging inferno over my next adventure. Part of what I find important about the work I do is to push myself to places I&#8217;m uncomfortable going. Giving myself goals that I think are only attainable if I remain sharp and be clever about how to get there. Another part thrives when I&#8217;m around people I consider more wise then myself, or people who help set up challenges for me, and the next adventure meets those requirements.</p>
<p>I took a position with <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com">Adaptive Path</a>. I paused for exactly nineteen seconds after pressing those keys because it still invokes a strange sensation. It&#8217;s a combo meal of sensations &#8211; excitement, slight disbelief, serious responsibility. It more than fully meets my requirements for a challenge laid out above, and the &#8220;it&#8217;s still sinking in&#8221; factor is high.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s like being a skater punk your whole life, then getting a chance to go on tour with Tony Hawk. The ambassador to skateboarding. The role model. Easily one of the best. The kind of guy that makes people like skateboarding even if they&#8217;ve never looked twice at a skateboard. Adaptive Path is the Tony Hawk of companies that do stuff for the web. And I have the distinct honor of working with them on a project that, like I said, has me raging like an inferno.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;m working with a team of great people on what will end up being a great project for everyone (including you).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just recently started using Apple&#8217;s Address Book, Mail, and iCal program fully. I&#8217;ve avoided them until now because I&#8217;ve been trained on Microsoft products, and rarely do apps bundled with the Windows install impress. In lieu of disappointment, I&#8217;ve used my own solutions.</p>
<p>I have to say, I&#8217;m really impressed with all three apps. The programs are light and simple, but collectively, I feel tightly organized. One thing that I really like about Mail is that it will show a picture of the sender if I have that person in my Address Book with a photo of that person. I read my email differently now that I see the faces of those who sent the email. Surely there&#8217;s some biological reason for this that I won&#8217;t get hung up on &#8211; nevertheless, I really enjoy that. But I have to know the person who&#8217;s face I&#8217;m looking at. Spammers won&#8217;t gain any advantage by sending me a photo of themselves in their spam. Deep within (or is on the outer layer?) of my brain, if I&#8217;ve heard your voice and seen how you speak, and then see your face, I can recall all the important behavioral bits about you, and it&#8217;s nearly as if you&#8217;ve popped into my office to chat instead of email me.</p>
<p>On that note, I really wish Apple would make a mobile phone. Not collaborate with Motorola or anything like that, but really, truly make a mobile phone. Don&#8217;t let it play music or anything like that. Just make it small and put good software on it, but most importantly, let me use it to take a photo of someone and with a single click say &#8220;This is Elvis Presley, the same Elvis Presley in my Address Book&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder &#8211; are there any mobile phones on the market that make this kind of thing quick and easy?</p>
