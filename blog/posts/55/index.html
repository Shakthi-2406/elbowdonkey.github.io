  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, I&#8217;ve finalized all my flight, hotel, and registration plans for <a href="http://www.sxsw.com" target="_self"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> <p>in March. This will be my first time going, and I&#8217;m excited, as I&#8217;ve wanted to go for the past&nbsp;several years.</p><br />
<p>Incidentally, if you&#8217;re going, and haven&#8217;t yet made lodging plans, I&#8217;d suggest doing so sooner rather than later. I found that almost all of the downtown Austin hotels were booked for that week.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google.html" target="">Google</a><p>&#8216;s company policy <em>Don&#8217;t be evil</em> is as simple as the site.</p><br />
<p>Not only do I think Google is one of the most useful tools ever, I also think they&#8217;re one of the best examples of a company ever. How a few nerds could pull this off is amazing, considering the pressures even from within their own company to cave to the &#8220;tried and true&#8221; marketing methods.</p><br />
<p>What they&#8217;re proving is that you can have a profitable business without an insane amount of advertising. You don&#8217;t need millions of features, you just need a few excellent ones. You don&#8217;t need to go public to have one of the most popular sites on the Internet. You can be a geek, and still maintain the original vision for your company.</p><br />
<p>It doesn&#8217;t even upset me that their new toy, <a href="http://www.froogle.com" target="_self">froogle.com</a>, could eventually put Price.com out of business. As a founder of <a href="http://www.price.com" target="_self">Price.com</a>, I always knew something better would come, and we&#8217;d need to be one step ahead of it. <a href="http://www.ekosm.com" target="_self">Erik</a> and I thought of froogle.com before Google was around, and we knew it would be a very powerful tool. But it didn&#8217;t make sense to those with the most say in the company. Marketing didn&#8217;t like it, the financial brains didn&#8217;t like it. Not selling banner ads was a very difficult idea for marketing to grasp, which is easy for me to understand. Google took a risk, and it payed off. We were too far into the game to take that risk, and I wasn&#8217;t able to make a strong enough case for it.</p><br />
<p>Google is being pressured to supress links to content that supports hate groups. The Church of Scientology filed a lawsuit against Google for linking to an anti-Church of Scientology website, claiming the site infringed on their copyright. People have made some serious noise about Google caching content that has since been removed by website admins.</p><br />
<p>My personal opinion on the whole thing: Google should supress nothing, cache away, link to everything, including copywritten material. It&#8217;s like a hammer. If someone hits you in the head with a hammer, you don&#8217;t sue Stanley tools, you sue the swinger.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=371" target="_self"><br />
<p>What&#8217;s your opinion?</p></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alaska Airlines sent me an email about their new <a href="http://vacations.alaskaair.com/AS_Disney/SpiritofDisneyland/SpiritofDisneyland.asp" target="_self">Spirit of Disneyland</a> <p>plane. On the page they&#8217;ve setup for the plane, they show how they painted it. I thought that was pretty cool, and thought it worthy of mentioning. </p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m always pretty interested in the process behind the creation of things. I used to be absolutely enthralled as a kid&nbsp;when a clip on how crayons are made would show up Sesame Street.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ve told Carrie time and time again that I want to travel around the US taking footage of factories in the process of creating something. Faucets, cell phones, pencils, pork rinds, whatever. No narration, no footage of&nbsp;humans,&nbsp;all shots designed like an illustration with a golden pallete, unravelling the mystery slowly. I could watch that stuff for days. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll get the chance to do that, so hopefully someone sees the brilliance in the idea as I do, and takes up the project. Ironically, if ever I had the ability to do it, it&#8217;s now, having both a camera and an Apple with the right stuff to do the job. I just don&#8217;t have the time.</p><br />
<p>Interesting coincidence: I was going to mention the link to the Alaska Airlines plane yesterday, but didn&#8217;t get around to it. I was looking at my logs for the day, and found that someone had ended up at my site from Google searching for &#8220;&#8221;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;oe=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;q=alaska+airlines+disneyland+plane&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Alaska Airlines Disneyland Plane&#8220;, but I hadn&#8217;t even posted anything about it yet. Odd. So where did they end up? &#8221;http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/home.cfm?id=315&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Here.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It took a while (I moved very slowly) but I finally moved my sites over to a <span class="caps">CFMX</span>/RedHat 8.0 box I&#8217;ve been building for the past month.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running into an odd bug every now and then (thanks to those who emailed about the resume being offline), so don&#8217;t be suprised if you see one yourself.</p>
<p>My eventual goal is to migrate my site to use <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">Moveabletype</a> for the blog stuff and ColdFusion for everything else. It already looks like MT and CF can live a very happy coexistance, which is delightful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie has a wide range of shreaks. Some are for when she&#8217;s unable to find a sock, or if she drops a spoon, or there&#8217;s a spider in the sink. Things that get me to come running from the other side of the Earth ready to fight whatever evil foe is ascending upon her.</p>
<p>Last night, as I&#8217;m experimenting with <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org" target="_self">moveabletype</a> <p>on my new webserver, I hear a mild noise from the&nbsp;kitchen. Like a big &#8220;umm&#8221; and, then &#8220;umm, Michael, fire&#8221;. I think she said something to that effect at least twice, but it wasn&#8217;t the usual shreak. Finally it kicks in, and I head out to the kitchen where she&#8217;s at with Leah in my arms, and lo and behold, there are&nbsp;twelve inch&nbsp;flames shooting up from the stove. She runs to me, grabs Leah, and gets out of my way as if I know what I&#8217;m doing.</p><br />
<p>It turns out that some goo was burning in the tray beneath the burner in a big way, and what looked like a much scarier thing went away with a lot of blowing at it. But it was one of those things that could have gotten crazy, so it was kind of hair raising.</p><br />
<p>This &#8220;opposites&#8221; in reactions thing&nbsp;from my lovely wife continue to suggest that at times we all have our <a href="http://www.movieprop.com/tvandmovie/Seinfeld/george.htm" target="_self">George</a> moments.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just stumbled across an interesting link talking about how much <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/union/pugwash/www/trees.htm" target="_self">paper</a> <p>a single tree can make. I had no idea the yield was so low.</p><br />
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did some math, and really, there&#8217;s no need to feel guilty for buying my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072132256/michaelbuffin-20" target="_self">book</a> as a Christmas gift for your neighbors and random people on the street. A typical tree could produce nearly 100 of the books, and at the rate they&#8217;re selling nowadays another tree will have germinated and grown to full height in the same space as the tree that produced the first 100. Besides, the damage is done, if anything, you&#8217;ll be doing the environment a favor&nbsp;by using the books to excercise your brain, or if you&#8217;re smart enough already, your arms.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=366#comments" target=""><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did some studying of some of the 100,000+ emails I received and determined two things:</p>
<p>1. One spammer sent the same message to at least 100,000 people with my email as the reply-to address, as well as spoofed the name of my mail server in the email headers (the IP does not match).</p>
<p>2. The spam originated mostly&nbsp;from Japan, but sometimes Brazil. I know the ISPs that were used, and I know the dial-up nodes he/she was on when it happened.</p>
<p>The question is, what can I do? I&#8217;d like to turn the account back on, but I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ll continue to get bombarded with &#8220;Cannot deliver&#8221; messages from the&nbsp;mail servers this person is assaulting. Also, I could see some mail server admins directing some misplaced anger towards me.</p>
<p>Looking at the email headers makes it quite obvious that the email did not originate from anything I control. and that my email server was not used as a relay to bounce email from Japan to the intended victims. The only email I am now getting is the &#8220;Cannot deliver&#8221; messages, which technically speaking isn&#8217;t spam, but is still killing my server.</p>
<p><a href="comments.cfm?id=365#comments" target=""></a></p>
