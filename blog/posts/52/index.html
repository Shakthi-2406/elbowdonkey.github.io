  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I was a bit freaked out Monday night, but after talking to people who have either had or know people who&#8217;ve had bypass surgery, it&#8217;s a pretty common&nbsp;thing with very high success rates. I still have yet to hear from my&nbsp;Dad, but I&#8217;m assuming that no news is probably good news at this point.</p>
<p>It hit me hard to know my Dad was at a point where he was basically taken down. My Dad is a workhorse, and has always been the best example I could ever have about work ethics. Not only does he work hard, he works hard at being the best at what he does, and is smart about it. I&#8217;m sure that having to stop to have some maintenance done is difficult for him. Heck, when I talked to him Monday night I had to chastise him for talking about a project we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>My Dad has also been the perfect example of patience for me. There was no testing&nbsp;his patience&nbsp;as a kid &#8211; it was practically infinite. We gave up pretty early on trying to push his buttons because there were none to push. Once, my brother and I went to go pick up some burgers from the local burger joint, and we convinced the cook that we&#8217;d take all the blame from our Dad if he placed a plastic lid of a cup in the burger. It had been a hard day of work, and we really wanted a good reaction from my Dad for this prank. We took the burger to him, he bit into it, pulled the lid out with his bite, pulled it from his teeth, set it down, and continued on, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that some of that work ethic rubbed off on me. I still complain, and get lazy, but for the most part, I work hard if for no other reason than that&#8217;s what my Dad would have me do. And regarding patience &#8211; I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s been pushed to the limits yet, but I know I have the capacity. We&#8217;ll see what happens when my kids are teenagers.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have expressed concern. Weblogs are a pretty special thing. To be able to speak my mind, and then have strangers express their feelings on what I&#8217;m feeling is profound; a feeling that&#8217;s hard to describe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just learned that my dad is in the hospital. He&#8217;s having open heart surgery tomorrow. I&#8217;d be lying if said I wasn&#8217;t scared out of my mind. I called him, he sounds confident. He says the doctors say 99% of people who undergo this surgery feel pretty good after several weeks of recovery.</p>
<p>I love my Dad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meeting you this morning outside of the Xerox building 63 was not a highlight. Sometimes one forgets his/her card key, and cannot gain access to the building. As I stood in the rain, waiting for someone to come along and modify my situation, I saw you approaching and was happy. You played a trick on the door with your hip and a special nudge and push, and opened the door. I exclaimed with joy for having the door opened, but felt ashamed for not having tried the hip move with added special nudge and push earlier.</p>
<p>When I said &#8220;Wow, I guess that&#8217;s the trick&#8221; you looked at me with great confusion, perhaps annoyed. I wanted to follow you in, but as you began to go in, you blocked my way. Why did you do that? You asked a lot of questions. &#8220;Who&#8217;s your boss? Where do you work? What department are you in?&#8221;. You kept asking. I kept answering. You asked me who the <span class="caps">CEO</span> was. I asked you back. You got the current <span class="caps">CEO</span> wrong. You stumbled, and got halfway through the old CEO&#8217;s name before getting it right.</p>
<p>Did you know I had a meeting at 8:30am, and that as you were eyeing my <a href="http://www.danger.com/products.php" target="_self">special telephone</a> <p>with fear and curiosity it was exactly 8:31am? Did you know that I had just walked to work in the pouring rain? I think you must have, as I made a great effort to make myself clear.</p><br />
<p>I apologize for storming past you. I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t resort to holding me back. I&#8217;m not saying I would have hurt you, but that little special nudge hip push nudge thump&nbsp;trick probably wouldn&#8217;t be looked upon as a good thing. I&#8217;m not happy that you followed me for five minutes as I walked to my cube. I had to do what I could to change the power struggle.</p><br />
<p>That wasn&#8217;t a nice thing for you&nbsp;to do, and I believe you were being very hypocritical with your Fonzi stylings.</p><br />
<p>I urge you to <a href="comments.cfm?id=399" target="_self">reply</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was all amped up about doing dance moves, but apparently no one wants to see me boogie. It&#8217;s a shame.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/carrie" target="">Carrie</a> <p>came up with a good idea last night at dinner though: Is it Australia or Not. I could take a picture of my food, and people could rate how close to looking like Australia my dinner was. Brilliant!</p><br />
<p>My left arm has been twitching for two days. It&#8217;s not a mystery as to why either. I was telling Carrie about how violent kids are (well, mainly boys, and mainly just me), and that led into letting her punch me really hard in the arm. Well, she used the oft misunderstood knuckle shot, which gave me a fleeting monkey bump on my arm. It protruded about a half inch for a few seconds, but not long enough for Carrie to see it. She thinks I imagined it, but she forgets about things like swellbow, and his cousins hipper and pickle finger. And now my arm twitches.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not afraid to admit this, because I think it might lead to professional help, but I have a dance problem. Carrie does too, but her condition is less advanced than mine. It&#8217;s hard to explain why, but there are moments when I leap to my feet after a moment of inactivity, and perform a unique and one of a kind dance movement. Tribal in nature.&nbsp;We think it has something to do with a bit of cabin fever. We&#8217;re spoiled Californians living in a place that gets colder than I&#8217;ve ever lived in (the mid thirties) so we spend a lot more time indoors. Everyone who has lived here forever has these high tech jackets and coats that keep them warm. We have no idea where to get those things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m considering making my own dance instruction video. Turn the energy into profits. It would be easy, because most of the dances involve the placing of your body parts into different planes than they&#8217;re traditionally accustomed to. A favorite: straighten your arms, push them groundwards, jump and try and push your butt as high in the air as possible, and kick legs violently, simulating flight. If you can get some wiggle in the rear end, you&#8217;ve got a winner. The whole idea is to try and create a flurry of motion that you can never possibly recreate.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea. <a href="comments.cfm?id=397" target="_self">Describe a dance move</a> <p>like I have above, and I will try to perform it. I&#8217;ll even get it on digital video and display the fine results on this site somewhere. Kind of like <a href="http://www.emotioneric.com" target="_self">Eric Conveys an Emotion</a>, but with short dance interpretations instead.</p><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it was dryer than it is now, I was hitting the Oregon skateparks pretty frequently. The best of the parks are built by <a href="http://www.dreamlandskateparks.com/" target="_self">Dreamland</a><p>, a name that is pretty legendary for those who care about nice skateparks. They started the legendary status with <a href="http://www.oregonskateparks.com/Parks/Burnside.htm" target="_self">Burnside</a>, which appears in one of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. A picture of <a href="http://www.skateoregon.com/Newberg/Newberg.html" target="_self">Newberg</a> has graced my site for at least the past several months.</p><br />
<p>Kent Dahlgren, the guy who handles public relations and media stuff for Dreamland found my site through Google.com. My educated guess after looking at my google referers log file is that he searched for sites linking to dreamland.com. The fact that he went as far as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.dreamlandskateparks.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" target="_self">page four</a> to find my site shows tenacity.</p><br />
<p>It turns out that Kent also works for Xerox, and that we&#8217;ve been working a hundred feet away from each other since August, and we didn&#8217;t find this out until he figured out through my site that I too was working for Xerox.</p><br />
<p>So today, over Thai food, we realized that not only did we work at the same place, but that we&#8217;d shared similar experiences over the past few years. Fatherhood, dot com stories, skateboarding injury stories, pranks, Oregon drivers and thier complete lack of driving courage which drives us both nuts. It was a good lunch, and hopefully now that I know a man on the inside I can have the opportunity of hurting myself on their new parks before anyone else does. Had I gotten more than three hours of sleep the night before, I might not have sounded like Ozzy.</p></p>

I&#8217;d still point the current name here to maintain links coming in, but it struck me that a better, more simple name might be of some worth.
