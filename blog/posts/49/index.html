  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&#8220;The war with Iraq is a great economic opportunity for the U.S. and for the Republicans.&#8221;</em><p>&nbsp; &#8211; <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/03/030318the_war.html" target="">Jason Kottke</a></p><br />
<p>With all due respect to <a href="http://www.kottke.org" target="">Jason Kottke</a>, I wholly disagree.</p><br />
<p>If anyone can say that the war with Iraq is a great economic opportunity for the U.S., then that opportunity is shared by all policital parties, not just Republicans. It&#8217;s not like card carrying Republicans will split up some kind of bounty, or spoils of war, and Democrats will be denied any benefit. Conversely, in an economic slump, we all equally share the pain. </p><br />
<p>And, more towards the jist of the paragraph following the sentence quoted, I&#8217;m not convinced that war + stimulated economy = reelection for Bush in 2004.</p><br />
<p>Making the statement even more baffling: the fact that the cost of a war is stupifyingly tremendous means it can do little, in my opinion, to strengthen any economy. My opinion might not mean much here because I&#8217;m not an economist &#8211; but neither is Jason. But to say that any political party has the most to gain from a war gets my goat in a tuffle.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=434" target=""><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading Jason&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/03/030318five_years.html" target="">post</a> <p>about his <a href="http://www.kottke.org/98/03/980314why.html" target="">first weblog entry</a> five years ago motivated me to go check out my old ones. I read this <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/home.cfm?id=300" target="">entry</a> from time to time to remind me of the passion I had for things. I wrote this entry, and within a few months had co-founded a company, and made some great friends and learned a whole heck of a lot. I regret that I didn&#8217;t do much blogging during the incubation of <a href="http://www.price.com/" target="">Price.com</a>. It would be interesting to read, and be able to share with others.</p><br />
<p>I still have this kind of enthusiasm, but it&#8217;s interesting to look back and see how it&#8217;s changed. Before&nbsp;I had a sort of &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kick ass no matter what&#8221; kind of attitude, but now I know that that alone doesn&#8217;t cut it. You have to know how to kick ass, sure, but you don&#8217;t get far if you don&#8217;t stop and think things out, and strategize more. So, if I was a bar room brawler then, I&#8217;m closer to a ninja now. I didn&#8217;t say I was a ninja alltogether, but I&#8217;m closer than I was nearly five years ago.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One time, in the bathroom, as Carrie was brushing her teeth and I was undoubtedly trying to annoy her, we both spotted a huge ant. Huge in relative terms. We&#8217;re used to little specks of ants, no bigger than a few millimeters in length. This ant was huge; at least a quarter inch long.</p>
<p>This morning, I spotted a gang of them in the kitchen, moving slowly due in part to their enormous-for-ants size. I can&#8217;t simply kill these ants with my thumb, they&#8217;re too big, and likely juicy. So today, I&#8217;m going to The Home Depot to get a hammer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I can control these ants, using microchips and a Nintendo controller. I&#8217;ll use them to carry laundry to the washer. Comb my hair. Weed the garden. Ants could be a very powerful force if controlled by man.</p>
<p><a href="comments.cfm?id=432" target="">If you could control an army of ants, how would you use them?</a> <p>And army ants don&#8217;t count, they just kill and mame, and can&#8217;t be controlled by man.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was my first time to <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, even though I&#8217;ve been hearing about it for a couple of years. I knew it was going to be fun, but only if I stepped out of my comfort zone and socialized and made sure I went to all the events.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I hid behind my camera a lot. I hate standing amongst a group of people just listening. I&#8217;m a bit selfish I think &#8211; either I want to be an active participant, or not be a part at all. It&#8217;s something I need to work on. With the camera, I have an excuse to be away from the crowd, occupying myself. This kind of anti social behavior can yield some nice shots, but can also turn into a frustrating struggle. More than once I had to drag myself into groups, taking a break from photography and spending some time listening or contributing.</p>
<p>When I did force myself to meet people, I met some very good people. People like <a href="http://www.tribolum.com/" target="">Lucian</a><p>, <a href="http://www.consolationchamps.com" target="">James</a>, <a href="http://www.crabwalk.com" target="">Josh</a>, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104634/" target="">Ernie</a>, <a href="http://littleyellowdifferent.com" target="">Ernie</a>, <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/" target="">Brad</a>, <a href="http://www.jish.nu" target="">Jish</a>, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/" target="">Anil</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/" target="">Matt</a> helped make me feel more comfortable. I didn&#8217;t spend much time with <a href="http://www.torrez.org" target="">Andre</a> or <a href="http://www.stupidfool.com" target="">Ben</a> and <a href="http://www.dollarshort.org" target="">Mena</a> Trott. Andre&#8217;s and my paths didn&#8217;t cross much, and I was very shy in meeting the Trotts. I respect the work they do so much, and felt a bit intimidated. I regret not talking to them more.</p><br />
<p>The panels and keynote speakers were great too. <a href="http://www.wheretheressmoke.net" target="">Kevin Smokler</a> is not only an excellent first baseman, he&#8217;s an eloquent and inspiring speaker. Enough so that he encouraged me to share my book publishing experience in front of a pretty big group (which was a bit scary).</p><br />
<p>I come away from <span class="caps">SXSW</span> feeling rejuvinated. I have a renewed interest in the possibilities of the web, and what it can do to bring people together. I&#8217;m going to do more to improve my skills as a&nbsp;web applications developer, and spend less time in the pure pursuit of money.&nbsp;I&#8217;d love to attend the event again, if only to meetup with a fine group of people once again, and to recharge my batteries in preparation for spring.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If not for the expiration dates widget, I&#8217;d have poured an unhealthy sloshing (and possibly gloppy)&nbsp;portion of rancid milk right onto my Grape Nuts the second I arrived home from <span class="caps">SXSW</span> tomorrow.</p>
<p>And speaking of <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, I haven&#8217;t even had time to write anything here since it kicked off. Even now, I risk missing out on the strawberry yogurt downstairs at the hotel breakfast buffet. It&#8217;s a hot commodity, and I don&#8217;t feel satisfied unless I eat all of it, leaving none for others. Despite the lack of time, I should remind myself that when I do have time later I need to share some stories about the people I&#8217;ve met and the new friendships I&#8217;ve gained.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It all started normal enough. She&#8217;s a grandma, drives a bus in Portland, so does her husband. But what started as friendly conversation with someone on the plane turned into one of the most awkward moments of my life.</p>
<p>She claims that she, a grandma and bus driver, is Marilyn Monroe reincarnated. Now, without even doing any math, I know she&#8217;s nuts, but she roped me in. She didn&#8217;t just blurt out <strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m Marilyn Monroe!&#8221; </strong><p>She started off subtle. Told me about her grandkids, what it&#8217;s like to be a bus driver, how she likes to paint. We were in full conversation when she just slipped that in. In between talking about giving people Italian ices on her bus and how she only gets about three five minute breaks on her shift.</p><br />
<p>She was dressed in all black. She claimed it warded off disease. &#8220;People underestimate the absorption of black you know.&#8221;</p><br />
<p>I began to do a lot of nodding. I forced myself to fall asleep. I woke up to the smell of bananas. There were two peels on the foldout tray, and she was working on a third.</p><br />
<p>She said she just took an IQ test, and it had tricky questions like &#8220;What is half of thirty added to ten?&#8221;, which, one would conclude is twenty-five, but they&#8217;d be wrong. It&#8217;s seventy, because according to her, half of thirty is sixty.</p><br />
<p>Anyhow, I&#8217;m actually thankful for the nut balls I meet in my life. It was either her or stare at the back of the seat in front of me.</p></p>
