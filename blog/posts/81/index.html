  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just discovered a concept I was blissfully unaware of &#8211; weblogs. Turns out there&#8217;s a huge mess of weblogs out there. Where was I? I&#8217;ve been doing this thing forever, but I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve been doing it longer than weblogs have been around. In some ways my ego is hurt; I didn&#8217;t think of it first, but in others, I&#8217;m excited about the idea that there are tons of people just like me who feel the need to say something on a website that rarely gets any visitors (actually, there&#8217;s been a ton of traffic lately, easily nearing 750-1000 people a day, which is amazing considering the low bandwidth and antique server I&#8217;m using).I guess everyone who runs weblogs probably runs them for the same reason I run my site &#8211; we like to share what&#8217;s on our minds. I&#8217;m trying to achieve <a href="http://glassdog.com/lance/life_serial/2000/092800.html" target="_blank"><span class="caps">PIPA</span></a>, even though I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s not worth it. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I grow more tired of the Internet every day. It used to be fun, exciting, new ideas surfacing on a near hourly basis, incredible optimism.Now the bubble is burst.And what&#8217;s with the popup banners &#8211; I type the <span class="caps">URL</span> of my bank, and up pops a competitor. Yahoo! is to blame. Yahoo, I used to have so much respect for you, then came the selling of porn thing, then the aggravating popup adds for mini wireless X10 cameras pitched by attractive young ladies (does this suggest that by owning X10 cameras young attractive women will enjoy your company more or does it suggest that these cameras are good for spying on people? Can&#8217;t wait to see the peeping tom stats for this year)&#8230;The &#8216;net just ain&#8217;t what it used to be, and perhaps it will make a comeback, but I doubt it will ever keep me as inspired as it used to.</p>

It just occurred to me that I&#8217;ll need to make a site for the book. I have to write 15 chapters while working fulltime for onProject.com. It&#8217;s a bit difficult.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I witnessed the fury of nature last night as thunder storms stomped all over the tri-state area (I never thought I&#8217;d say tri-state area, but it&#8217;s just as equally stupid sounding as saying Southern California and thinking it sounds perfectly normal).I can say without question that lightning struck at least 3 times within 100-300 yards from me as I was standing in the fury taking pictures. It was probably a stupid thing to do but I&#8217;m from Southern California, and I think I&#8217;ve seen a thunderstorm like this maybe once in my life, so I wasn&#8217;t missing this.<br />
I made sure I wasn&#8217;t the highest point on the land (I was surrounded by trees and telephones poles and 4 story building). One of the trees surrounding the clearing near my hotel was struck as I was standing there &#8211; I may have a picture of it happening, although I haven&#8217;t looked at the images yet. I was going to make sure to get a picture of the tree this morning but was running late to work.That tree was standing all proud and happy, and then <b><span class="caps">WHAMMO</span>!</b> it exploded into a ball of fire. The camera was taking pictures in sequence as it hit with long exposures, so we&#8217;ll see if it shows up. The instant the lightning struck the thunder clap hit as well, and along with it rain and hail were suddenly drilling down. That was crazy, so I went back inside. I took more pictures out my window. The whole thing only lasted about 45 minutes but the power went out from a lightning strike (it was close by because the sky flashed about every color of the rainbow for a good 20 seconds after the first white flash). People at work here don&#8217;t seem to think that storm was a big deal, but to me it was like the world was crashing in. I think the fury of that storm got my adrenaline pumping more than a California earthquake ever has.<br />
This morning I saw that lightning had struck a telephone pole near the parking lot of my hotel, and a building across the street, and a tree behind my hotel (the same one I mentioned).<br />
I&#8217;ll post pictures of the storm later today.</p>
