  <div class="entry-content"><p>My site now shows up in the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/" target="">weblogs.com</a> recently updated list. It&#8217;s not doing anything fancy right now to communicate with <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/" target="">weblogs.com</a>, but pretty soon I think I will write a custom ColdFusion tag to interact with the site. When it&#8217;s done I&#8217;ll probably make it available here and on the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/" target="">weblogs.com</a> site.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a plane went down in <span class="caps">NYC</span>. It&#8217;s too early to tell how or why it went down, but it still sucks. Best guess is that it is not terrorist related, and that it&#8217;s a mechanical problem.</p>
<p>I flew yesterday, and took a good look at the cockpit doors with the new &#8220;reinforcements&#8221;. Apparently, billions of&nbsp;tax payer&nbsp;dollars buys you some erector set pieces that bolt to the door and a peephole with a sticker underneath that states &#8220;Secured Door&#8221;. I wish I had a picture of it, because it&#8217;s really something amazing.</p>
<p>At first when I heard the government was gonna bail out the airlines, I thought it was a good idea, but now I think it&#8217;s just stupid. We&#8217;re expecting the airlines to spend our money wisely. That&#8217;s like expecting the government to spend our money wisely. Huge bloated organizations leak and spend money like crazy, and we&#8217;re thinking billions of dollars will magically fix the situation and magically stop terrorists from getting on planes. Why on earth is Argonbright still the security firm for most airlines? How is it even possible that they&#8217;re still in business?</p>
<p>This is just one more reason why everyone needs their own <a href="http://www.moller.com/skycar/" target="">personal flying car</a><p>. Let the free market take over, let airlines go out of business, let people figure out how they&#8217;ll get somewhere. It&#8217;ll all shake out, it may change our lifestyle, it may make things difficult, but in the end it will all work out.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ekosm.com/" target="">Erik</a><p>&nbsp;put an <a href="http://www.ekosm.com/v03/index.htm?month=2001-11#11011" target="">entry</a> into his log that brought my wife to tears, and would have done the same to me had I not already known about the situation. There is no doubt in my mind that web logs are serious forms of communication that can have immeasurable impact on peoples lives. Even if I were a total stranger to <a href="http://www.ekosm.com">www.ekosm.com</a> I would have been moved pretty deeply by Erik&#8217;s feelings, expressed for anyone to see.</p><br />
<p>While I didn&#8217;t know Dale personally, I knew him through Erik, and I too share in Erik&#8217;s feelings on his death. Dale&#8217;s physical limitations have been removed, his trial complete. He endured to the end and his strength and courage will not be forgotten.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did some <span class="caps">HTML</span> polishing. This page used to be over 45K in <span class="caps">HTML</span> alone, and it&#8217;s now been cut at least in half. I stripped out a lot of table tags and went with using div tags instead. To be perfectly honest, I&#8217;ve only looked at it in newer browsers, and it seems to work just fine.</p>
<p>One added benefit of the div tags is that they seem to render faster than tables do, so it just feels faster now.</p>
<p>The new graphic above is one of the escalators that leads to the top of the World Trade Center. I always liked this picture, and still really enjoy to this day. I don&#8217;t feel bad about having it up, if anything it reminds me of how impressed I was with the towers, and it reminds me of how much I enjoyed New York the last time I was there. The fact that the picture is tilting shouldn&#8217;t suggest anything about the collapse of the tower &#8211; visually it just worked out that way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For months now my brothers and I have been obsessed with the idea of getting some space where we can put a halfpipe of our very own. The obsession itself is an interesting one, and warrants it&#8217;s very own blog. In a few days I will have a blog devoted purely to the quest to have a halfpipe of my very own. It will describe the trials and tribulations of obtaining space, building the beast, and eventually riding and respecting it. Expect to see a link soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember the <span class="caps">SNL</span> fake commercial about a fart filter? Well it turns out that some freakish company actually sells a <a href="http://www.fartypants.com/" target="">fart filter</a> (not the fancy talking variety, but a more primitive method). I&#8217;m almost ashamed to even link to this, but I consider it a &#8220;good service to the public&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think that the <a href="http://www.alienware.com/" target="">AlienWare</a> <p>website is probably the best designed online computer retailer site I&#8217;ve seen to date. Customizing a machine is very easy and intuitive, and quite impressive. But that&#8217;s not the only reason why I&#8217;m impressed with AlienWare. Not only can you get a bright red computer, you can get it loaded with some insane hardware. Want dual 22&quot; <span class="caps">NEC</span> monitors? No problem, there&#8217;s an option to set it up that way. Need 4 76GB drives? Again, not a problem. Need a 1 year onsite warranty? It&#8217;s free with every system. My next computer will be an <a href="http://www.alienware.com/main/configurator_pages/mj12.asp?RetrieveQuote=mb10534@yahoo.com-68709" target="">AlienWare computer</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re back. For those of you who didn&#8217;t already know, Carrie and I went on a cruise to the West Indies last week. It was a lot more fun than I would have thought, and I must say I&#8217;m truly impressed by Celebrity cruises. We stayed on a ship that was less than a year old, so it was in tip top shape, but on top of that, the staff worked incredibly hard to make the experience enjoyable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very much a &#8220;hands on&#8221; kind of traveler. I like to explore and do things on my own and not feel like I&#8217;m stuck to a schedule. I thought I&#8217;d feel trapped on a cruise, but I never once felt stuck. There are so many things to do on the ship, and so many things to do on shore that it&#8217;s impossible to be bored. I have only one complaint, and it&#8217;s minor: I wish we&#8217;d stayed longer at the ports. Maybe a day extra for a few of the islands. You have to get in, check out the island, and get back before the boat leaves you. It&#8217;s a sort of hurried pace, but it&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on getting photos up now, expect them within the next few hours.</p>
