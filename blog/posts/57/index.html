  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not into talking politics on my blog,&nbsp;but I am into pointing out crybabies when I see one. The comments by Tom Daschle in this <span class="caps">CNN</span> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/20/daschle.threats/index.html" target="_self">article</a> <p>sound like excuses made by the loser in a third grade student body election.</p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;Rush Limbaugh and all of the Rush Limbaugh wannabes have a very shrill edge&#8230;&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>Shrill edge? I don&#8217;t even know exactly what he means by that, but I don&#8217;t share his opinion. When I hear shrill edge, I think of Axl Rose screaming a heavy metal angst ballad about how his leather pants chafed his tender cheeks.</p><br />
<p><em>&#8220;But what happens when Rush Limbaugh attacks those of us in public life is that people aren&#8217;t satisfied just to listen. They want to act because they get emotionally invested.&#8221;</em></p><br />
<p>So, getting emotionally invested in political matters, as opposed to just listening, not voting, and doing nothing is the better alternative? Is it even American to suggest that getting emotionally invested in politics is a bad thing? When you protest a war, you&#8217;re getting emotionally invested. When you support a political idea, you get emotionally invested, and either fight for it, or against it. You don&#8217;t just sit there like a lukewarm pile of gelatin.</p><br />
<p>Rush Limbaugh, and I can assume he&#8217;s also pointing at Sean Hannity like to promote conservastism and pick at liberalism. They don&#8217;t attack people, they attack political positions presented by people. You can scream at me at the top of your lungs about how you hate that I think <em>x</em> political thought, but for me to infer that you&#8217;re attacking <em>me</em> isn&#8217;t a very intelligent inference.</p><br />
<p>I think Tom Daschle is a cry baby, who, because he&#8217;d rather not point at himself or his policital party for failing to retain political control, would like to blame a few guys who have a greater degree of influence of Americans than he does. Guys who have every right under the Constitution to say whatever they feel about Tom Daschle&#8217;s political opinions, and get people emotionally invested in politics.</p><br />
<p>And heck, if you don&#8217;t like negative attention, don&#8217;t become a politician. It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s&nbsp;being forced to be a politician.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I understand. Apple has a near perfect corporate identity. It goes so deep as to dictate how a brand new iMac is packed. Down to the protective ring of foam that surrounded the smooth plastic of the expansive 17&quot; inch wide screen. It inspires me to get creative with such a perfectly formed tool.</p>
<p>Which I&#8217;ve already started doing. Shortly, I&#8217;ll be creating an online&nbsp;video gallery of my rapidly growing and developing daughter for the benefit of those who haven&#8217;t been able to pop in from California to visit.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be shipping out some home brewed DVDs with video content, and hopefully (if I can figure it out) every photo we&#8217;ve taken of Leah since she was born. Now that I actually own one, I understand the Mac fanatics, at least somewhat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I couldn&#8217;t do this with a PC. I could, but the level of difficulty is magnitudes higher. I consider myself a PC expert, down to the core. Which is why I can attest of the difficulty &#8211; in order to achieve the same results on my PC as far as time and quality of output is concerned, I&#8217;d spend the same amount of money that I spent on my iMac buying a good video capture card, fast harddrive, cables&nbsp;and software. And that&#8217;s without taking into account that the card might not even play nice with my PC.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last two days learning about some of the Macromedia MX products at a seminar, and most importantly, and hardcore session yesterday afternoon on ActionScript in Flash MX. I have to say, despite the little things that get my goat about <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/" target="_self">Macromedia</a> <p>now and then, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/" target="_self">Flash MX</a> coupled with the lastest version of ActionScript is some pretty hot snot.</p><br />
<p>This is probably only really interesting to me, and in a way, is a not-so-subtle, even if I think it is,&nbsp;method of tooting some kind of horn, but during the seminar, the new <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/" target="_self">Contribute</a> product feature tour was displayed on the big screen. I hadn&#8217;t thought much about this new product, until the presenter clicked on something that kicked off a video of a developer talking. I studied the face, and realized immediately that this guy had given me a job interview last year, and that this <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/" target="_self">Contribute</a> product was probably the product they were so secretive about.</p><br />
<p>Part of me wishes that I could have worked on the project &#8211; it would have stretched me, and forced me to learn a lot more than I already know, but the other part of me (the meaty part) realizes that I wouldn&#8217;t have had the experience of having a child (maybe San Francisco water would have made me sterile?) and all the other cool things that have happened since then. It&#8217;s one of those things that if you think about for too long, you&#8217;ll fall asleep, and begin dreaming about lawn gnomes sawing on your legs with bucksaws.</p><br />
<p>During my two day seminar, I was out of touch with the world. Last night, and today, I counted six emails requiring attention, three new voicemails on the cell phone, and seventeen voicemails on my work phone. Apparently, when closing escrow on selling a condo, you need to be available by phone. Fancy that.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve kept a saltwater mini-reef <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/images/aquarium/" target="_self">aquarium</a> <p>for some time now. In the past year, I&#8217;ve moved it from Autobytel, to Aliso Viejo, to Oregon, and most recently, to a second location in Oregon. I&#8217;m probably going to move it within a week from the kitchen to the office at our Oregon apartment.</p><br />
<p>It goes without saying that this is a small tank, or else it wouldn&#8217;t be moving so often. 7.5 gallons to be exact. It&#8217;s needs aren&#8217;t that great &#8211; the most important things it needs are light and freshwater topoff. As water evaporates, the salt is left behind, which makes the salinity rise. Salinity needs to be maintained at a certain level for optimal &#8220;health&#8221;. It all sounds complicated, but it&#8217;s really pretty simple. Keep the water level correct, keep light on the tank, and do a water change every so often, and you&#8217;ve got a living reef, in nearly perfect balance.</p><br />
<p>Now, for some reason, the lights on the tank quit last week. They simply died, and it sent me into a panic. I really do love this tank, and enjoy the challenge it brings, as well as the serinity of watching it change slowly day by day. Giving up was not an option, so I launched into a stressful search for a replacement light.</p><br />
<p>I replaced the old lights with my dream light. A high end, German engineered 150 watt <span class="caps">HQI</span> Doubled Ended Metal Halide <a href="http://www.sunlightsupply.com/aquarium/products/reflectors.shtml#ro3plus" target="_self">pendant</a>. A bad ass light. Capable of pumping out over&nbsp;12,000 lumens with the perfect spectrum for supreme coral growth. A bluish/white light brighter than anything I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve drooled over a setup like this for over seven years.</p><br />
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was the sudden influx of jumping from 3 watts per gallon to 21 watts per gallon (which is an enourmous jump in reef terms, overkill in fact) or if it was because a route of escape was now possible, but today at lunch we found a hermit crab on our living room floor, exhausted from a pretty big journey.</p><br />
<p>In scale terms, it would be like jumping off of a twenty story building, and walking several thousand feet, all while holding your breath, and then, curling up in your shell with the last drops of air, waiting to die. Pretty crazy.</p><br />
<p>He&#8217;s back in the tank now, and hasn&#8217;t moved much, but he&#8217;s moved a little, so we&#8217;re hoping he&#8217;ll be fine. If not, the other hermits have him for dinner, which is just one of many savage things that happens in a reef aquarium.</p><br />
<p>And for those who are in the reef aquarium hobby, yes I&#8217;m going to be getting a bigger tank. A 20-30 gallon tank, to help get those watts per gallon down just a hair.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wrestling with a bug in Dreamweaver MX for the past few weeks, and I&#8217;m beginning to think Macromedia doesn&#8217;t care much about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only one either. Take <a href="http://www.onrelease.org/index.php?m=200211#79769682" target="_self">Aral</a> <p>for example, he found <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;threadm=apbu7i%24109%241%40forums.macromedia.com&amp;rnum=1&amp;prev=/groups%3Fq%3Ddreamweaver%2Bwsdl%2Berror%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26selm%3Dapbu7i%2524109%2" target="_self">this</a> problem a month before I did. Truly annoying. This is the company that &#8220;merged&#8221; with my beloved Allaire, a serious &#8220;listen to your customers&#8221; type of company, and while they&#8217;re hyping up the MX empire, they&#8217;re&nbsp;not doing what&nbsp;contributed a lot to Allaire&#8217;s success:&nbsp;paying&nbsp;attention to the customer.</p><br />
<p>It&#8217;s even more annoying that the ColdFusion MX server, out of the box, seems pretty shakey. It took me forever to get it to work with Apache 1.3, and that was after trying to get it to work with Apache 2.0 only to find out it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. The potential for <span class="caps">CFMX</span> is huge, but it&#8217;s hard to win customers with something that seems unstable.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;m saying &#8220;seems&#8221; alot because most of what I&#8217;ve found wrong with <span class="caps">CFMX</span> are my own fault. Trying to use it with Apache 2.0 being one of them. If I&#8217;d done some research, I would have found that it couldn&#8217;t be done. If I&#8217;d done some more research, I&#8217;d have found out that if you don&#8217;t turn off the friendly errors in Internet Explorer, you get the standard IE error for normal ColdFusion errors. So when I thought <span class="caps">CFMX</span> was simply dead, I spent an hour trying to figure out why it was &#8220;dead&#8221; on one <span class="caps">CFML</span> file, only to realize that it was simply some bad syntax. My beloved CF 5.0 would simply spit out an error, rather than provoke IE to show me it&#8217;s own errors.</p><br />
<p>Still, my stupidity doesn&#8217;t mean Macromedia doesn&#8217;t have a problem. I&#8217;m not the only one, and with enough people like me falling into these stupid pits, Macromedia will end up with a serious reputation problem. Perhaps not of their own doing for <span class="caps">CFMX</span>, but certainly with not addressing issues.</p><br />
<p>I&#8217;ve been a diehard <span class="caps">CFML</span> programmer for over seven years now, and let&#8217;s just say that <span class="caps">JSP</span> and <span class="caps">PHP</span> are starting to get a little more play, just in case.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are the kind of things I like see. A <a href="http://www.innogear.com/duex.html" target="_self">128MB MP3 player</a> <p>the size of a pack of gum.</p><br />
<p>If&nbsp;a person&nbsp;talks too much&nbsp;of what one dreams, it can lead people to believe they know a little something about that&nbsp;person that might be better left unknown. I&#8217;m willing to risk writing about my dreams two days in a row, because damnit, it&#8217;s just so cool to dream that you&#8217;re a special intelligence photographer who&#8217;s trapped in a building in Tijuana during the great America vs. Mexico-full-on-war. And you have the nanokey! A key that can pick any lock!</p><br />
<p>New pet peeve: I really hate it when people, when opening an all glass door, palm the door on the clean glass to open it. That&#8217;s why there are handles, so the rest of us don&#8217;t have to see an oily palm print of a straight-armed neanderthal.</p><br />
<p>Wonka is a funny word. We&#8217;re only used to it, and don&#8217;t think of how funny it actually is because we&#8217;ve all grown up hearing it. Also, it&#8217;s easy to roll almost any word around in your head long enough and come to the conclusion that it sounds funny. This is a dangerous game.</p><br />
<p>I saw three joggers today running in the pouring rain. That by itself is impressive, but even more impressive &#8211; they were naked. Except for their shorts and shoes.</p><br />
<p>When driving west on <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;addr=&amp;city=Portland&amp;state=OR&amp;csz=Portland,+OR&amp;slt=45.523830&amp;sln=-122.675346&amp;zip=&amp;country=us&amp;BFKey=&amp;BFCat=&amp;BFClient=&amp;cs=7&amp;name=&amp;desc=&amp;poititle=&amp;poi=&amp;ds=n&amp;mlt=45.490570&amp;mln=-122.655047&amp;mag=9&amp;newmag=10" target="_self">SE Holgate</a>, don&#8217;t forget to turn right before it&#8217;s too late, or you&#8217;ll be doing donuts on the island next to the hidden &#8220;Do Not Enter&#8221; sign as parents shield their childrens eyes so the crazy man in the white truck doesn&#8217;t give them a fright. Also, even though the previous warning exists in all cases, it is emphasized when there are millions of cars going millions of miles per hour all around you, and directly at you if you failed to head the warning.</p><br />
<p>Chili&#8217;s gravy in a styrofoam &#8220;take out&#8221; cup looks so much like mashed potatoes that it might fool you into thinking they gave you extra mashed potatoes. Don&#8217;t be fooled!</p><br />
<p>And finally, it&#8217;s haircut time again. The last lady who cut my hair said &#8220;This haircut will last 2 months or your next haircut is free.&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember how long ago that was, but either way, I&#8217;m going to claim it was under two months and see what she thinks about that.</p><br />
<p><img height="90" alt="I should be ashamed." src="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/images/hair.jpg" width="120" border="0" /></p><br />
<p>Those are headphones, not Princess Leah Hair Buns. And that&#8217;s the postage stamp size shots my T-Mobile Sidekick takes. Almost National Geographic quality.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my dream I was sitting around a glossy beech conference table. The gloss provided by a layer of thick epoxy, forever preserving the freshness of the wood locked inside. Sitting to my left was Hulk Hogan in a well tailored suit. His usual layer of cocoa butter was missing, leaving him looking a little less lethal, and a little more approachable. </p>
<p>On the rounded corners to his left sat Dick Clark, youthful as always, and another Dick Clark, a mirror image of the first except for a blindingly brilliant golden bicuspid, casting a soft&nbsp;gold reflection on Jessie Ventura, who was sitting directly across from me. Jessie had a spiderman suit on, the hood/mask pulled down. If he wasn&#8217;t bald, you&#8217;d notice partially sweaty hair. His eyebrows took over this task instead, showing that he&#8217;d just been involved in some type of crime fighting action.</p>
<p>Wonder Woman (the cartoon, not Linda Carter), to his left, asked, or more appropriately, declared &#8220;Food.com is a vastly more valuable domain that Foodnetwork.com, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;. All eyes were on me, at which point I launched into a lengthly explanation about how the name wasn&#8217;t as important as the content, how the Food Network was branded as the Food Network, there might have a better time with a matching domain and -</p>
<p>The phone is ringing. It&#8217;s 5:21am. We let it go to the answering machine. It&#8217;s a fax. There&#8217;s no one on this earth who needs to fax me something at 5:21am. I narrow the scope to this earth, because I have no idea if faxes from space follow the same ettiquite. My fax machine is out of paper, and as if the call wasn&#8217;t annoying enough, my fax machine is more annoying by accepting the fax into memory, then beeping every ten seconds to inform me that it would like some paper to print the fax on.</p>
<p>I walk into the office, and yank all cords out of the back of the machine. The fax machine is unplugged.</p>
<p>I vow to sue a fax spammer within 6 months time. It&#8217;s now my sworn duty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this article on an alloy trademarked as <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,43538,FF.html" target="_self">LiquidMetal</a> <p>pretty interesting.</p><br />
<p>When I was in highschool, I was on the &#8220;dumb track&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t an official line of education, but it&#8217;s one they would steer educational misfits like myself for lack of any better idea. It was a track for those who weren&#8217;t entirely college bound, weren&#8217;t athletes, and weren&#8217;t honors students. This usually meant I shared the same classess with most of the same guys, who, as it happened, we&#8217;re the same guys I&#8217;d end up skateboarding with in the afternoons.&nbsp;It didn&#8217;t bother me much to be on this track, I knew that highschool was probably slowing me down more than anything, and that if I just go through it I&#8217;d soon enough be able to kick some ass.</p><br />
<p>The dumb track included a lot of metal working classes, so the above article might mean a little more to me than someone who spent most of their highschool education reading about taming shrews and mice and men and such. We built things, like grappling hooks, hammers, cannons, some built bongs (which I mistook as fishing pole holders in my innocence). We even built a vehicle&nbsp;with four wheel steering/four wheel drive, and had a lawn mower engine for each wheel. A guy named Alex broke his leg in three spots when his foot slipped off the bar of the chassis, and it got mangled up as the monster rolled forward.</p><br />
<p>Any talk of metallurgy gets me nostalgic for the good old days of hammering red hot metal with my bare fists, and using my teeth to machine things on a lathe. Real manly work. Now the closest workplace related injury I come to is sore finger tips.</p><br />
<p>I should mention, just to give the whole &#8220;dumb track&#8221; idea a stab, that I know of at least two people who were in the same track as me that went on to start very successful businesses, and one who became a pro skateboarder, and is now rolling in millions as he branches off into merchandising all over the place. Someday I&#8217;ll rant at how schools need to be&nbsp;adept at assessing talents, and helping student focus on those talents, with supporting classes, and standard classes to keep the kid well rounded. Another time.</p></p>
