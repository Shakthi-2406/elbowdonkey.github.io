  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have two new friends, they are now named Fred and Ethel. They became my friends yesterday when I discovered the Joys of HalfpipeÂ©. I&#8217;d take pictures of these new contusions, but Carrie has the digital camera in Munich, and the webcam would reduce their beauty.<br />
I rode a true state-of-the-art halfpipe yesterday for the first time (I&#8217;d been on one that was practically made of cardboard before, when I was about 13) and I must say that now more than ever I want to figure out how to get a half-pipe in my garage. I did much better on this halfpipe than I thought I would. I can drop in without hesitation, do five-oh grinds, pump fakey or do frontside/backside turns. I&#8217;m quite pleased (and sore).<br />
I know I&#8217;ve been talking about skateboarding, almost excessively. It&#8217;s because onProject let me go, and skateboarding is my mind numbing drug of choice, not to mention, not having a job frees up some time for it. They hired me several months ago, and were really hoping I&#8217;d move out to New Jersey where they&#8217;re located. I seriously considered, to the point of almost packing everything up and moving out there, but family things came up, and it just wasn&#8217;t the right thing to do.<br />
They offered quite generously to let me telecommute from home, which I&#8217;m still grateful for. After a while though, it became obvious that for the kind of work I was doing was simply more difficult over an Internet connection. They were paying for an &#8220;expert&#8221; and only had someone writing code. I wasn&#8217;t able to offer guidance in the design of things as easily because I wasn&#8217;t there. My productivity was hampered by trying to work through technical issues that would have been fixed quicker (or not come up at all) had I been there.<br />
I think we all learned something valuable &#8211; telecommunting doesn&#8217;t always work. I&#8217;ve seen it work before, but this time it didn&#8217;t.<br />
I haven&#8217;t decided yet if I&#8217;m going to hunt down another job. I have a book to finish, and might be able to afford having the book as my full time job. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.<br />
Although, I&#8217;m still <b><a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/resume.cfm">open for job offers</a></b>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got on the board again today and had one of my best days yet. I&#8217;m learning that skateboarding is a whole body thing, not just a feet thing. It sounds like a pretty stupid epiphany, especially for someone who&#8217;s been skating as long as I have, but it&#8217;s working for me.<br />
I find that if squat more, bend more, pump more, go faster, that it&#8217;s much easier to pull what I want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, I slammed hard skateboarding. I know what I was trying to do this time, except I ended up horizontal at about 5 feet in the air.With pain still lingering in my recently injured tailbone, I did everything I could to land on anything but my butt. In retrospect, I really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice of where or how I&#8217;d land. I ended up landing on my right side. My shoulder hit hard first, then my head, and then the lower half of my body.I remember thanking whoever did such a good job on making my helmet at that point.Now, several days later, I&#8217;m once again an old man. My neck is especially tender, must be a bit of whiplash or something.My wife is rad &#8211; I think most wives might forbid me from getting on the board again, but she puts up with my moaning, names my significant contusions, and encourages me to do well. She&#8217;s awesome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At around 2am this morning someone called me. They let the phone ring a long time, and when I finally realized that the ringing sound wasn&#8217;t a mossy green elephant giving me instructions to build a bridge out of the new grape flavored licorice from here to Hawaii, and woke up, I was too late. They&#8217;d already hung up.<br />
This morning I looked at who had called on the Caller ID, and it was a private caller. No one ever calls me at 2am, so my curiosity drove me to press *69, which calls the last person who called me. I&#8217;d get to the bottom of this.<br />
Well, the phone rang, I heard a busy signal, and a cheery female robot voice said something like &#8220;We called the number, and it wasn&#8217;t busy at the time, but it&#8217;s now become busy. We&#8217;ll call you back with a special ring when it&#8217;s free.&#8221; OK, I was actually impressed that the robot was friendly enough to do this for me. So I waited. About 3 seconds later, the special ring! I picked it up, expecting to unviel and hopefully wake up my 2am caller, and I once again heard the same cheery message. The line was free, but was now busy, I&#8217;ll get a special ring when it&#8217;s free.<br />
I think the line was free about 20 times, then busy. I was stuck in some crazy loop. At this point, I was tired of the phone ringing, and suspected that the person who called me last night was a robot telemarketer. Now, my robot friend was trying to do me a favor, but trying way to hard, driving me crazy. I&#8217;d ignore the special ring, but to no avail, my cheery robot friend would inform me that the line was free, but was now busy.<br />
I still don&#8217;t know if it will stop. It seems to have sensed my discouragement, as it&#8217;s trying the line less often now, but just when I think I&#8217;m free of this over-achieving phone entity, it will send me the special ring.<br />
The moral of the story: There are evil robots that are pure evil and make no efforts to disguise their evil core, and there are more evil robots, who disguise their evil core with cheery voices, helpful attitudes, and special rings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sore. I wonder sometimes if I&#8217;m a wuss and get hurt easier/quicker than others, or if this is the way it feels for everyone.Last week I took a pretty big hit to my hip doing something on the pyramid at the skatepark. It hurt like hell and I still have a three dimensional purple lump on my left hip. I&#8217;d give a picture, but it&#8217;s really not something you want to see. My wife and I have affectionately named the lump &#8220;Petsy&#8221;. Long story.After the fall, where my leg meets my body, it simply hurts all the time. I have a hard time lifting my leg. This is the second time it&#8217;s happened. I also fell on my still very tender tailbone. I&#8217;m going to construct an inflatable suit. That&#8217;ll solve everything.</p>
