  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/" target="_self">Mena</a> <p>received some <a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/archives/000580.shtml#000580" target="_self">funny spam</a>. Normally I&#8217;d chuckle at the entry, and move on, but in this particular case, I think I may have actually&nbsp;played a role in the&nbsp;origins of this&nbsp;piece of spam. Keep in mind this is a big maybe, but here&#8217;s how the story goes.</p><br />
<p>At my first Internet job back in &#8216;95, some coworkers and I were discussing the strange viral patterns of chain emails. Discussion, as it always does, quickly moved into the question of &quot;If you could time travel, would you try to go back and mess with David Hasselhoff&#8217;s career to be spared from him today?&quot; (Remember, back in &#8216;95, Baywatch was in full swing). Just as quickly as conversation jumped to hypothetical time travel, the conversation took both ideas, time travel, and email and combined them into one idea.</p><br />
<p>If time travel were possible, those who had the ability would likely lay low, and not make a big deal about it. But they might be willing to share the ability with someone who they truly felt was worthy or in need of the ability. </p><br />
<p>Thus, over greasy taquitos, a task force was assembled to send out an email with the intention of convincing time travellers to share their knowledge with us. The ploy to get them out of their shell was something like &quot;I was a time traveller. I lost&nbsp;my special time travelling device somehow, I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;working on a cure for cancer for the past 100 years, and I&#8217;m close to a break through, but I&#8217;m 91 and will surely die soon.&quot;&nbsp;We&#8217;d tickle the fancy of&nbsp;humanitarian time travellers, because evil ones were likely not to share.</p><br />
<p>We were a medium size <span class="caps">ISP</span>, with many email addresses. We had friends who were also medium sized ISPs. With our combined pool, we were going to start the base at about 25,000 active emailers. A pretty good start.</p><br />
<p>The problem is, as ideas spawned at lunch usually go, the idea was &#8220;lost and forgotten&#8221; after lunch. I was supposed to come up with the text, another coworker was going to ready the spam machine, and another coworker was going to write a script on the email server to see if it was getting forwarded out by our customers to satisfy our curiosity.</p><br />
<p>Until today when I saw Mena&#8217;s post, I figured it never happened. But now, I suspect that it did happen, and the email she got was a direct product of that lunch conversation&nbsp;seven years ago. Whether I not I can prove that is going to be hard. I plan on tracking down those who might have been involved and ask them about it.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is so <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/26/pledge.allegiance/index.html" target="_self">last week</a><p>, but I needed to make a comment.</p><br />
<p><em>&quot;A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools is an unconstitutional &#8216;endorsement of religion&#8217; because of the addition of the phrase &#8220;under God&#8221; in 1954 by Congress.&quot;</em></p><br />
<p>The common argument I&#8217;ve been hearing and reading supporting the ruling almost always includes the phrase &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221;. The argument usually goes further to suggest that &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; is a constitutional right.</p><br />
<p>The term &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221;, or anything even remotely resembling that phrase appear no where in the <a href="http://www.federalist.com/histdocs/constitution.htm" target="_self">United States Constitution</a>, and that includes the <a href="http://www.federalist.com/histdocs/billrights.htm" target="_self">Bill of Rights</a>, and the 11th through 27th <a href="http://www.federalist.com/histdocs/amendments.htm" target="_self">ammendments</a>.</p><br />
<p>Thomas Jefferson used the phrase in <a href="http://w3.trib.com/FACT/1st.jeffers.2.html" target="_self">response</a> to a letter from the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut dated January 1, 1802, nearly fifteen years after the Constitution was signed.</p><br />
<p>The First Ammendment to the Constitution (ratified in 1791)&nbsp;states:</p><br />
<p><em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</em></p><br />
<p>Given what I know about the Constitution, I can&#8217;t see how the word &#8220;God&#8221; in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. No one is forced to utter the Pledge, and furthermore, using the word God in the pledge does not prohibit the free exercise of religion, threaten freedom of speech, or discourage the right to peaceably assemble. </p><br />
<p>You can believe in no God and retain all of the rights granted in the Constitution. Uttering the phrase does not reduce your right to be agnostic or atheist. It might seem stupid and pointless if you don&#8217;t believe in God, but it doesn&#8217;t threaten you in anyway. Taking offense to something you don&#8217;t believe in is like me taking offense to Martians. I don&#8217;t believe they exist, but boy do I get offended if I read a book or see a movie with Martians.</p><br />
<p>That&#8217;s my rebuttle against the &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; argument, and whether or not it&#8217;s unconstitutional. How do I feel personally?</p><br />
<p>I believe in God, and I believe in one Nation under God. I would, however, prefer that that phrase not be uttered mindlessly at city council meetings. The second commandment prohibits taking the Lord&#8217;s name in vain, and to me, this includes using the word or any form of it as an exclamation, profanity, or in something like the Pledge, which in and of itself has lost it&#8217;s importance because of mindless, rote&nbsp;repetition.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_self">Google.com</a> <p>almost makes me cry. They are everything an Internet company should be. Humble, understated, willing to share, fantastically smart, promoters of&nbsp;the pursuit of knowledge. They value employee morale with the utmost regard. They take calculated risks, and pick the right tools for the job. <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/02/07/03/1352239.shtml?tid=95" target="_self">This interview </a>with Google&#8217;s directory of technology says it all.</p><br />
<p>Something that struck me from the interview, and something that I&#8217;ve always believed in is that employees generate stronger bonds, higher, more productive levels of communication, and come up with more ideas when they have outlets for group fun in the office. At Google, they play pool. At Price.com, we&#8217;d play tournament style&nbsp;Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Some of our sessions produced amazing ideas because people from different backgrounds and with different opinions felt relaxed enough to say what they thought..</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My left leg has been twitching for over two days. I&#8217;m beginning to go mad because of it. This usually happens after performing a &#8220;new exercise&#8221;; I can&#8217;t figure out what this new excercise was, other than perhaps walking more than usual this weekend.</p>
<p>I used to get in these moods where walking just didn&#8217;t cut it. My locomotion required running. Even if the distance was only a few feet, say from my office to the bathroom, or my car to my mailbox. And it wasn&#8217;t a jog. Note that I have never mentioned <em>jogging</em><p>, I have only mentioned <em>running</em> which is defined as moving swiftly on foot so that both feet leave the ground during each stride. Try that move while jogging and you&#8217;re likely to do the splits and pull something special.</p><br />
<p>And to me, moving swiftly meant moving as swiftly as possible, which meant running as if a the Teletubbies had laser beam eyes and woodchipper mouths and motorcycle legs chasing me screaming &#8220;Big Hug!&#8221;. That meant running so fast that the threat of physical injury from the rapid, near out of control motion, was almost assured.</p><br />
<p>I think I need to start doing that again, to stop the twitch.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie mentioned something the other day as I was relating the story of a crazy English teacher I had in junior high. She said &#8220;Michael, you need to write fiction, you obsess about interesting people, and it&#8217;s obvious that you enjoy talking about the characters you meet in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think I could probably write fiction, but it wouldn&#8217;t be something that would come with ease. Like anything, it would take practice. It would take failures and successes and repetition to get good. I prefer instant results. Let&#8217;s see how good I can do using my &#8220;Instant Results&#8221; method.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong></p>
<p>Bruce was a five year old plumber. It wasn&#8217;t obvious to most, but I knew.&nbsp;It was most most obvious that Bruce was a plumber when his twin brother Lloyd would practice his wrestling moves on other children. The half nelson was, not suprisingly, half as painful as the full nelson. Lloyd was a garbage man.</p>
<p>Lloyd and Bruce had a game they&#8217;d play against the unwitting. It was called the &#8220;Digging for Gophers&#8221; game. Lloyd would execute a half nelson that would advance into a genuine full nelson on a sandy blonde kid wearing a striped Izod Polo, orange courduroys, and blue Vans slip ons. While the kid was secured, Bruce would begin to dig with fervor at a gopher hole in the schoolyard. One might mistake Bruce as an in-ground pool installer, but it was obvious he was a plumber. Bruce wore stiff blue demin jeans, and shirts too small for his larger than normal five year old chubby&nbsp;body. Bruce didn&#8217;t wear underpants. In the midst of Bruce&#8217;s digging fervor, it was obvious that Bruce was a plumber. </p>
<p>Being forced to view Bruce&#8217;s plumber&#8217;s crack wasn&#8217;t as terrible as what Bruce was trying to produce. Bruce knew how to make gophers come out of their mysterious hidden dens underneath the kickball field. To a certain segment of the kindergarten population, gophers were terribly ferocious beasts, that if left unguarded, would gnaw your eyeballs out or chew your ears off. Their buck teeth and digging claws were implements of horror. Gophers were concentrated death and destruction in rodent form, and their stories of terror and gore were reported with clockwork regularity.</p>
<p>Bruce would dig and&nbsp;collapse their evil lairs until they&#8217;d have no choice but to face and fight whatever was destroying their well laid plans of kickball field domination. The scorned gophers would scatter from the dust storm and stand with teeth borne and claws at the ready. At this crucial moment, garbage man Lloyd would make full use of the motivational qualities of the full nelson to present his capture to the ready-to-fight gophers.</p>
<p>There is nothing more terrifying in this world than a gang of gophers who have just been foiled. Full nelsons have no power over a child facing the most terrifying things in the world. Hulk Hogan would have done well to channel his thoughts and think of gophers when dueling Rowdy Roddy Piper.</p>
<p>Lloyd wasn&#8217;t as big as his brother, in fact, Lloyd was pretty standard in size. Lloyd lost the lock, and the sandy blonde kid lost his fists in Lloyd&#8217;s face. Not one to underdo things, the sandy blond kid employed his favorite wrestling move, the head lock with the taboo crotch grab.&nbsp;He began dragging Lloyd away from the Terrible Place, towards a place more suitable for inflicting punishment. Bruce objected of course, and made a threatening motion, at which the sandy haired blonde kid reemployed the taboo crotch grab with extra intensity. This motived Lloyd to&nbsp;scream at&nbsp;Bruce to go get&nbsp;a teacher.</p>
<p>Not one to leave things unfinished, the sandy blonde kid dragged Lloyd to the trash can, kicked the can over, and while squeezing even harder on both the headlock and taboo crotch grab, yelled &#8220;Get in filthy friend of gophers!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lloyd shamefully got in, and with a kick from the sandy blonde hair kid to the can, rolled away into first and second grader territory, where he was promptly captured and used as&nbsp;the newest victim in their Punch You Hard game.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong></p>
<p>Too bad it&#8217;s not exactly fiction. The only fictional part is Lloyd rolling away in a trash can. He <em>was</em> <p>turned over to first and second grader territory where he was pummeled. Bruce got in trouble for making me cry, and I got in trouble for grabbing Lloyds crotch. It was a move I learned from having an older brother who had no other weakness when it came to wrestling. I&#8217;m still not too happy about gophers to this day. I don&#8217;t like walking through a field with obvious gopher activity, for fear of stepping in a weak part and breaking my ankle, and for fear of just seeing one of the terrible beats.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Supporting the idea that Blogs help hold the promise of the Internet, by chance, I found the blog of a very talented and determined young woman who worked for Price.com. I was thinking about Google&#8217;s catalog search feature, and was wondering if Google had any competition in this category when I came across <a href="http://www.annajoaquin.com/" target="_blank">Anna</a><p>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.annajoaquin.com/resume2001.html" target="_blank">resume</a>.

<p>I&#8217;m often curious about what happened to the crew at Price.com after it downsized, and I&#8217;ve kept in touch with as many people as I can, but lost track of <a href="http://www.annajoaquin.com/" target="_blank">Anna</a>. I&#8217;m glad to have found her, as her blog is well worth the read.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyday I think the Internet sucks more and more. Spam advertising the most vile things, ads for casinos, and popups for mini cameras. It starts to make me sick.</p>
<p>I remember being deeply entrenched in the promise of the Internet. I&#8217;d try to illustrate the vision and grandeur of the Internet that I expected to anyone who listened, and when I first saw a <span class="caps">URL</span> show up on a billboard, I knew the rocket was launching.</p>
<p>Now that the rocket has crashed it&#8217;s hard to have that same passion, the same enthusiasm. Building the Internet in my own way has been what I&#8217;ve done for the past 10 years. It&#8217;s part of me like my arms are part of me. Having it plagued by the most vile of carnival barkers is very much saddening.</p>
<p>But, through the wasteland, green shoots have developed, and offer renewed promise. There are special exceptions that have endured the storm. Blogs endure, and I expect will always endure, as people and thoughts endure. News sites will endure. Since September 11th I&#8217;ve made a habit of scanning <span class="caps">CNN</span> on a regular basis. It seems to me that anything I hear on the radio or on a national news cast is simply repetition of what I&#8217;ve read during the day.</p>
<p>Of course, this could all be my own perspective, just as someone who loves Backstreet Boys might expect Backstreet Boys fan sites to endure forever.</p>
