  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, to elaborate, yesterday I got an email through my site from Jeff Zaslow, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. It said:</p>
<p><i>Please contact me asap. I&#8217;m a reporter from the Wall St. Journal working on a story about Bill Gates&#8230;and enjoyed your piece on what you&#8217;d do if you had his money.<br />
I&#8217;m at [xxx-xxx-xxxx]&#8230;or e-mail me your number. I&#8217;m on deadline.<br />
Many thanks.<br />
Jeff Zaslow<br />
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WALL</span> ST <span class="caps">JOURNAL</span></i></p>
<p>So of course, the first thing I&#8217;m thinking is &#8220;total scam&#8221;, writers never write such short emails, or abbreviate part of a brand name, but a quick lookup of the email address and Jeff&#8217;s name confirmed it was probably for real. So I replied with my home number, told him to give me a call. During the second half of the mouse click, when the button returns to it&#8217;s unclicked state, my phone rang, and there was Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff was fun to talk to. We immediately began talking about <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/perm.cfm/id/555">this blog entry,</a> where I just sort of freestyle about what to do with Bill&#8217;s money. He&#8217;s curious about the obsession, how often I think about <span class="caps">BGM</span> (Bill Gates Money) and why I think a lot of people think about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB109044535077470150-H9jf4NhlaB3oZ2qZoCIb6eAm4,00.html">The article that Jeff published</a> represents me pretty accurataley, though he leaves out that I&#8217;m a co-founder of Price.com (which is fair, I guess) and that I mentioned nano-technology at least fifteen times when talking to him. Also, he suggests that I &#8220;wonder if Mr. Gates has ever cruised around the Internet, typed in &#8216;Bill Gates,&#8217; and come upon [my] blog&#8221;. I actually don&#8217;t ever wonder that, though I remember Jeff asking me the question. I&#8217;m sure I said something like &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s possible Bill Gates has read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, I thought it was a fun diversion from the daily tasks. Thanks Jeff! Don&#8217;t forget about the exercise machine I suggested Bill could design for himself to combat the weight gain from nano-cilia moving floors!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a couple of things that I&#8217;ve been meaning to say, and just haven&#8217;t got around to it yet. But they&#8217;re spilling over, and you can&#8217;t hold good things to say for too long with hurting something:</p>
<p>Dogs don&#8217;t really know what they&#8217;re doing when they bark. Think about it for a second. You&#8217;re a dog, and your daily routine consists of tiny sparks of emotion that generally point you in the direction of a.) food b.) sleep c.) goofing around with other dogs/people d.) sniffing/licking in embarrassing ways e.) perpetuating the species. So when a dog barks, it&#8217;s just overwhelmed with one of these emotions, and, if we could put it into words, says to itself &#8220;dang, you know, I really gotta just start opening my mouth and make a big loud noise, maybe something good will happen&#8221;.</p>
<p>I always think, when I see a Chevy with a gun rack in the window, that all it would take is one good pothole and you&#8217;d end up with your head on a meat hook with a shotgun flopping around.</p>
<p>Nature is a funny thing when you stop and think about it. It&#8217;s constantly building up amazingly intricate and complicated things like trees and Praying Mantii (Mantises?), and even some stuff that takes millions of years, and then it comes along and destroys it with the same enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Leah pointed to the knob on my wrist where my ulna bone (or is it radius) meets my hand a few weeks ago and without encouragement declared &#8220;birthday cake&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t even aware she knew the phrase, and furthermore, that that is what you called that knob.</p>
<p>And finally, take a look at the Wall Street Journal tomorrow. To keep it all mysterious, I will say one thing: I was interviewed by a <span class="caps">WSJ</span> reporter today for something truly special. Beyond that, I will say nothing. I can&#8217;t even guarantee that the story will print.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m about to get technical, have no fear.</p>
<p>For the past week and a half I&#8217;ve been trying my hand at learning Perl. For a few days I was seriously stumped. The code uses more punctuation than it does alpha-numeric characters, and can be super difficult to understand. Yesterday I had a breakthrough of sorts. I was able to read a huge text file, split it into an array, and drop it into a MySQL database. For me, that&#8217;s a big step.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking &#8211; could I do it quicker using ColdFusion? What took me over a week in Perl to create took me about 20 minutes to create in ColdFusion (which should be unsurprising &#8211; I&#8217;ve been writing ColdFusion code for nearly 9 years now, and Perl for 9 days). As it turns out, I used ColdFusion and Java to pull the file in, and it took CF+Java 3 seconds to do what Perl did in 16 seconds.</p>
<p>Knowing that Perl is supposed to be super good at handling text files, I had a friend who knows Perl well test out the code I&#8217;d written in Perl on his machine, and it ran in a second or less.</p>
<p>So, I declare &#8211; there&#8217;s something wrong with Perl on my Mac. After more testing, it appears that any time I try to access a file on the Mac with Perl, it takes at least 10 seconds, no matter what I do with it. I&#8217;m curious if other Mac users have seen this issue with OS X and Perl as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I were sitting around talking the other night, with absolutely nothing better to do (note: extreme sarcasm) when the idea to put a computer in the kitchen came up. We thought it would be cool to be able to scan our groceries as they arrived, and keep an inventory. Then we could link that up to a recipe database, and have the computer suggest recipes based on ingredients we had on hand. We reasoned that we&#8217;d waste less food, probably eat in more often (sometimes the hardest thing about coming up with dinner is ideas of what to make) and ultimately save money.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve really been putting some thought into it. I have a very old Toshiba laptop that could be paired up with a bar code reader that could handle just the data entry. I could send the data to my more capable server in the garage, and put it all into a database and build a web interface to it. Broken down, it would only take a few simple pieces of hardware and software to make it really effective.</p>
<p>The question is &#8211; does anyone know if super cheap barcode readers (like, around $20.00) and also, any sites or software that I can feed ingredients to and get recipes back?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I once decided that I wanted to major in advertising. I was going to do clever things, and win Cleo&#8217;s and all of that. I gave up on that though because in the end, it wasn&#8217;t all that interesting. I tell you this only to sort of set the stage for my next big life question:</p>
<p>Who decided that recording say, five people, all saying the same bit of copy, and then splitting up their audio or even video, then splicing it all together so that they can switch between all the people saying the same bit of copy was a good idea? I really hate that. Sometimes they&#8217;ll only use maybe three people, and split it up enough so that you see the same person a few times. Is this supposed to conjur up warm fuzzies, because we see a familiar face or hear a familiar voice? You know I think? I think the next person who makes an ad like that is the next person who I&#8217;m going to avoid giving money to. That and the Ball Park Franks people, with their &#8220;girthy&#8221; hot dogs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Carrie and I have been wondering how long the flags will be at half mast. We vaguely understand that the flags are down because of the death of a President, but we&#8217;re not sure who tells the flag owners how long to keep it up.</p>
<p>If I had a flag pole, would I have gotten the memo? Will they fly in full force on July 1? Maybe they&#8217;re still up because one flag pole guy sees the other guy&#8217;s flag at half mast, and thinks &#8220;looks like it&#8217;s a half mast day, again&#8221; while at the same exact time the other guy is thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>Or maybe I have it all wrong, entirely. Maybe there&#8217;s a flag hoister strike going on. It&#8217;s some kind of union thing. Fifteen tugs on the rope instead of thirty until wage disputes are taken care of. Rope shortage? Stronger gravity? Increased capillary action strength, as a result of global warming, resulting in accelerated oxygen uptake and consumption, requiring twice the energy to hoist the flag as normally required? It&#8217;s all too disturbing! I can&#8217;t handle it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,1592,a10-c440-p205,00.html">Mirra</a> chair arrived two weeks early, which means two weeks that would have originally been shortened from my life have been returned. The spine liquifying Office Depot chair is now cradling books instead of butts.</p>
<p>The Mirra chair is very comfortable. It&#8217;s a joy to sit in if you&#8217;re feeling achey &#8211; it gives great back support, and the mesh seat hugs your butt like a fine pair of tighty whiteys. Incidentally, the chair back is pure white, making it look like something a Stormtrooper from Star Wars would enjoy sitting in, if not for the white plated armor pinching them in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>But now I think I might be a mutant or something, because I have a few issues. First, when I adjust the chair just so, with my feet flat on the ground and the elbow rests at the perfect height for good keying, I see that my desk is too high. If my desk were lower I&#8217;d be keying and mousing without any unnatural bends in my wrist, but on the flip side, my monitors would be far too low (they already seem low).</p>
<p>I could, you say, easily just raise the monitors and lower the desks, but that would be folly. The desk is solid. It&#8217;s not going any lower &#8211; a keyboard shelf is in order. The displays are another animal entirely. One is a traditional <span class="caps">CRT</span>, and could be lifted easily enough (old Linux book, $6.00 at Powells) but the other display is an Apple Cinema Display, and the only way I think I could raise it is by hanging it from a rope. I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly 6 years ago I <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/mb/perm.cfm/id/300">hinted at an idea for a project</a> that I&#8217;d come up with in an oh most exuburant way (I have a hard time stomaching my old writing and sometimes even my naive enthusiasm).</p>
<p>That idea ended up becoming <a href="http://www.price.com/">Price.com,</a> and behind the great idea a team of great people formed, and we did a lot of really cool (and sometimes difficult) things. The project was my life, and I poured a ton of myself into it.</p>
<p>Now, nearly four years since leaving Price.com, after having been out on my own doing consulting and writing a book, I&#8217;ve gone back to Price.com. I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;ll be able to once again feel a great deal of personal pride for a successful project, and hopefully rebuild once strong relationships.</p>
<p>In the next several months I&#8217;ll be soliciting feedback from people I respect, and taking my original ideas and the ideas of people like <a href="http://www.errorik.com">Erik</a> and rolling it into a new reincarnation of the site.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already grateful to <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil</a> for filling my head with all sorts of good ideas, and to <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/">Andre</a> for giving me <span class="caps">PERL</span> coding tips and helping keep the ideas flowing, and to <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a> for at least nodding his head in approval for all the ideas I send him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suppose with any large community there&#8217;s ample room to piss someone off. A while back I removed a photo from <a href="http://www.wordPhoto.org">wordPhoto.org</a> because I thought it broke one of my rules. Rule number 6 says &#8220;No obviously Photoshopped images.&#8221; The image I removed looked Photoshopped, mainly because the writing looked like Comic Sans or something like that. In any case, it was too uniform for a human hand in my opinion.</p>
<p>Someone who wanted to remain anonymous dropped me a note pointing to the <a href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:TCYJRD34PbYJ:www.onechildleftbehind.com/+wordphoto&amp;hl=en">site of the owner</a> of the original photograph that I removed. On his site, he does a lot of ranting about how I&#8217;m a censoring Nazi and a lot of stuff that&#8217;s pretty harsh in my opinion.</p>
<p>If I look past the attacks, the general idea I get is that he thinks the motivating factor for removing the photo is because he poked fun at people who post multiple times (despite Rule #7, which says &#8220;You may submit as many photos as you like.&#8221;). He&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>The thing that really bugs me, is that in addition to the fact that this person doesn&#8217;t know me well enough to call me a Nazi, or &#8220;bleeding-heart&#8221;, or whatever, is that he never even tried to contact me about it. I could saved him a lot of anger and frustration had he just dropped me a line saying &#8220;what&#8217;s up with that?&#8221; and we could have talked it through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I arrived at <a href="http://www.daniafurniture.com/">Dania</a> there was a white Honda Civic in the process of getting a ticket from a motorcycle cop in the parking lot. A long cardboard box was sticking out of the trunk, and I figured they were getting a ticket for not having a red flag hanging off of it or something.</p>
<p>As I stood waiting for my chair, a girl from the car came and stood next to me, waiting for something herself. She was probably 18 or 19, and was obviously still ruffled from getting pulled over. After a few deep sighs and some huffing and puffing, she turned to me and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you believe that &#8211; that cop pulling me over, wasting <em>my</em> tax dollars? I mean really, what a waste. If someone wants to die that&#8217;s their own business. If I choose to not wear a seatbelt, it&#8217;s my own business. It&#8217;s a waste of tax dollars to pull me over for something that doesn&#8217;t hurt anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mulled over that for a moment, not sure if she was looking for me to ally with her insanity, or if she just needed to vent. I was a bit sleep deprived. Carrie gave birth to our new boy on Monday (a story I&#8217;ll share soon), and sleep was still in flux. I decided to respond, with a bright and cheerful smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah! You know, surely it must cost more to pay that police officer with his fancy motor bike than it does to pay all the highway clean up crews to come and scrape your brains off the pavement with butter knives after you go sailing through the sunroof! They probably just make minimum wage!&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought she might punch me in the neck, but instead she just did some more huffing and puffing, and waited for her bookshelf.</p>
