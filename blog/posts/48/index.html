  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil" target="">Anil</a> <p>busted out some <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005694.php" target="">big thinking</a> about recording the audio of your day, and using the audio to extract useful information. He says it a lot better than I, but I have to say, if I had an iPod or some device that I could use to review my conversations past, I&#8217;d find that very helpful. I&#8217;d win more arguments thats for sure, because I already remember everything I said exactly, but others often require proof.</p><br />
<p>But if I were the type to forget ideas and conversations, it would be great to be able to search the pure audio stream of my day to see what I said, and what was said to me. It might help me become a better person, because I might listen/read my previous conversations and realize that I might have been overly confident, cocky, or prone to exagarration. I&#8217;d see where I stepped on people&#8217;s toes, and where I could improve in my conversation skills. I&#8217;d be the perfect conversationist.</p><br />
<p>Also, even before Anil mentioned, I was thinking it would be really nice to have a portable Audivo. Like a Tivo, for audio. Plug it into your car stereo, use it to rewind live audio for those times when people scream almost understanble gibberish out their car windows as you&#8217;re roller skating in an acorn costume.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three months have gone by. Let&#8217;s see how I&#8217;m doing on those New Year&#8217;s Resolutions.</p>
<p><em>1. Cut my hair before it begins to put strain on my neck.<br /></em><p>I&#8217;ve got this one in the bag. My haircut meter is pure rock and roll gold.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>2. Give the milk a sniff before consumption.<br /></em>Expiration dates widget to the rescue once again. I have gone rancid milk free for 90 days.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>3. Finish what I start.<br /></em>This all depends on how you look at it. I&#8217;ve started and finished things in the past 90 days, this and many blog entries as the most obvious evidence, but I&#8217;m still having a hard time with bigger items.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>4. Resume my editorial&nbsp;illustration career.<br /></em>Haven&#8217;t touched a paintbrush or even doodled a happy face in the last 90 days. This makes me pathetic. I used to work on an illustration or two almost daily.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>5. Make serious progress on the big fancy secret project.<br /></em>I can&#8217;t remember exactly what the big fancy secret project was for January, but if it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking, then yes, I did this. And even if it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m thinking, it&#8217;s still a yes, because I&#8217;ve made some serious progress on a lot of possible big fancy secret projects. Unless that big fancy secret project was the &#8220;Cultivate Scorpion Venom&#8221; project, which is a negatory.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>6. Fall down less.<br /></em>I fell down once in 90 days. That is far less falling then Q4 2002, so I nailed this one too. Mother nature helped by making it impossible to even be in a position where I could fall.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>7. Become 100% debt free.<br /></em>Nearly there. Credit card is paid off weekly (we use it as cash) and I have a single car payment. Other than that, no debt.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>8. Teach </em><a href="http://www.thebuffingtons.com/leah" target=""><em>Leah</em></a><em> morse code instead of English as her first language.<br /></em>Not going so well. She prefers speaking caveman. Grunts, squeals, drool enhanced hums, etc. I&#8217;ve given up on this.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>9. Actually truly care more about friends and family.<br /></em>In the past 90 days I found out that I cared more about friends and family more than I&#8217;d thought when I wrote this. It&#8217;s funny how&nbsp;singular events can&nbsp;help shift focus so quickly.&nbsp;</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>10. Eat less Wheat Thins.<br /></em>Done. I think I was on a kick.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>11. Build a halfpipe.<br /></em>No halfpipe yet. But believe me, it&#8217;s not because of a lack of desire.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>12. Come up with a perfect system for managing wires.<br /></em>I should have been hospitalized for even aspiring to do this. It&#8217;s utterly impossible.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>13. Register my truck in Oregon.<br /></em>No deal. But it is an inch away from being registered and legal in the state of California.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>14. Realize my dream of training turkeys to play ping pong in the local county competitive table tennis circuit.<br /></em>I&#8217;m taking the first step currently. I&#8217;ve been playing table tennis after work for a couple of weeks now so that I can in turn train turkeys. At first, I was worried about actually being able to do this, but seeing that I&#8217;ve actually made some progress is a confidence booster. Surely, if I can play, turkeys can too.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>15. Ride a Segway.<br /></em>Not so lucky yet.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>16. Let </em><a href="http://www.stinkfactor.com" target=""><em>stinkfactor.com</em></a><em> die.<br /></em>This was a joke, so it&#8217;s not going to happen. I&#8217;ve not added anything to the site simply because I&#8217;ve been busy.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>17. Let </em><a href="http://www.stinkmachine.com" target=""><em>stinkmachine.com</em></a><em> flourish.<br /></em>One of the celebrity superstars of this project had a major health related adventure, which prompted a pause in this world wide domination (yet, cuddly and friendly domination) campaign. It will pick back up again soon.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>18. Armwrestle an astronaut, preferably Buzz Aldrin.<br /></em>I haven&#8217;t even tried doing this yet. I&#8217;m too lazy to set up the event. Please email me if you&#8217;re an astronaut, and you think you can beat me in an armwrestling match. I&#8217;ll let you know that you will beat me unless you&#8217;re super old and frail, or have no arms and are forced to forfeit, but to be sporting and for entertainment, please assume you don&#8217;t have a chance.</p><em></em><br />
<p><br /><em>19. Catch a cat hump (you gotta be pretty fast).<br /></em>Impossible. Even National Geographic wild life photographers can&#8217;t pull this one off. I must have been crazy to think I could this.</p><br />
<p><br /><em>20. Go a month without spending a dime, driving my car, or watching television.<br /></em>I&#8217;m waiting for a good time to give this one a try. I see it being possible though, just need to fall down and go into a coma first.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=444" target=""><br />
<p>How are you doing with your resolutions so far?</p></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a magic number. 70%. On personal projects, I get about 70% finished, then I get bored. I have a huge flurry of activity, then poof, the magic is gone, I&#8217;ve moved on to a new idea.</p>
<p>I need someone to pick up where I leave off. I&#8217;m not making an offer for employment or anything, just wishing out loud. I would be heavenly if someone or something, a trained monkey for example, could make up the final 30% of my projects, and allow me to take 100% of the credit, which is why I suggest a trained monkey. I can feel right about taking credit for the work of a trained monkey. Monkeys have no aspirations beyond food and comfort, so they&#8217;d be letting the &#8220;credit&#8221; go to waste anyhow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been giving this whole 70% thing some thought, and thinking of ways of reusing what I&#8217;ve done in the past to quickly jump start projects to at least the 30% mark (so I can use my 70% to get to 100%), and that seems to be going OK so far. For example, I&#8217;ve been writing a tool that writes code for me. A preliminary version is here on my site somewhere, but the current version is a lot better. I&#8217;m about 50% finished with this project, and already I&#8217;m starting to feel pooped, but I keep reminding myself that this one is important. This one is a proactive trained monkey if you feel like being funny and calling it that. It cuts down my development times by a wide margin, thus giving me a leg up on myself.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time for stretches. I&#8217;m jumping over a cubicle wall today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Termites eat through wood 2 times faster when listening to rock music.</p>
<p>Horse ants (a term I use to describe the monster ants in my house) run easily five times as fast in a completely haphazard fashion when you do little more than touch them. You might not ever think this about ants, but&nbsp;<strong>ants are&nbsp;hypocrits</strong><p>. They feel it&#8217;s fine to waltz all about your house going about their business, possibly even walking on your face in your sleep, picking are your fillings because we all know ants like shiny things, but when you touch them, they flip out. If you listen close, you can hear them screaming bloody murder about the unfairness of being disturbed by something. They gnash their teeth, spaz violently, and get all freaked out and crazy.</p><br />
<p>I want the ants to chill. Quit being such wusses. Get the hell out of my house, and quit trying to manipulate me with their tantrums. &#8220;Boo hoo, you disturbed me, now I&#8217;m going to run like a wild mustang and possibly maybe even fly uncontrollably off this counter top, and then won&#8217;t you feel like a jerk!&#8221;</p><br />
<p>A lot of people who have seen the ants suggest two things: 1. They&#8217;re forrest ants that like to eat wood, which means they&#8217;re eating my house [which I could care less about, because it&#8217;s really an apartment] and 2. They were here first, so really, they&#8217;re justified in freaking out. I say poo to number 2. I&#8217;m a human, and a polite human at that, but they&#8217;ve had that forest for millions of years, it&#8217;s time to share, or actually, just give it to me because I&#8217;m the boss.</p><br />
<p>And thus, <strong>my manifesto to the horse ants</strong>: Play nice, quit being babies, or I will take to killing you. As of yet, I&#8217;ve only expiremented with one of your gimpy looking friends, who you probably made fun of a lot anyhow because of his funny gait. He survived three days of being trapped under a cup which I had to trap him in when I realized that repeatedly rolling a highlighter over him over and over again made him severely <em>pissed</em> off. When he pushed the pen back to me, I realized he had freakish strength, and for the good of man and ant alike, needed imprisonment of the most secure kind. I will not spare you as I spared him if you don&#8217;t stop freaking out and walking about my house like drunken party guests. I have a hammer, and I will smash you with it, even though your bodies will make huge messes. I will not poison you like a coward, I will fight you face to face before I first use the meat tenderizer side that, because of its peaks and valleys might spare you for a moment, but then I&#8217;ll flip it around and show you who&#8217;s boss.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have no qualms talking about my dreams, because darnit, they&#8217;re whacked, and worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not big on recurring dreams, or even themes, but lately one thing has been popping up, and whether it&#8217;s a theme or what is up for judgment. One night at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> I woke myself up by singing &#8220;cowpants bubbleboy&#8221;. I&#8217;m talking real singing (well, real for me, not like Celine Dion or Britney Spears [shameless google bait]). I thought it was special.</p>
<p>Last night I had two significant dreams. The first was pretty vague, but I do remember waking up, and feeling that the most important thing I could do at that moment was say &#8220;cowboy bubblepants&#8221;. Notice the theme? Cow, boy, bubble, pants. Pants boy cow bubble. Boy cow bubble pants. It&#8217;s the perfect combination of words. No matter which order you put them in, they&#8217;re great fun.</p>
<p>The second dream started with an endless can of silly string. It was great! I was walking around work attacking people with silly string. I felt like I would get in trouble by someone, so when I did cover someone with silly string, it was accompanied by a lot of nervous laughter and had to be done quickly so I could run away.</p>
<p>Speaking of google bait, I&#8217;m tired of people coming to my site looking for the Michael Jackson Thriller Video. Let me state clearly: I do not have the Michael Jackson Thriller Video anywhere on my site. Please stop trying to guess where it&#8217;s hidden, stop emailing me, stop sending me pictures of you impersonating Michael Jackson.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did some estimations based on the expected military cost of the war, which the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/BUSINESS/03/18/warcost/index.html" target="_self">White House says is $95B</a> <p>(with estimates as high as $1.92 trillion). This figure includes money required for humanitarian efforts in Iraq as a result of the war. I came up with some ideas of what could be done with the money instead, without thinking about whether the scenarios are fair or feasible. Just food for thought.</p><br />
<p>I estimate that 20 million people in the US are unemployed. You could give every single unemployed person in the US a check for $4750 if you distributed $95B evenly. The number rises if you take out the unemployed who are dependants, are so wealthy they don&#8217;t need jobs, or those who simply choose to be unemployed. If I were unemployed, $4750 would do a lot to help get me through to my next job.</p><br />
<p>If the average cost of a four year college degree is $50,000, you could send 1.9 million people to school.</p><br />
<p>If the average four bedroom, two bathroom house costs $275,000 (probably high, but I&#8217;m from California), 354,454 houses could be bought and given to homeless families. No matter how you look at the estimates, that would make a huge impact on homeless populations. (Interesting data on homeless estimations: <a href="http://www.nationalhomeless.org/numbers.html">http://www.nationalhomeless.org/numbers.html</a>)</p><br />
<p>47.5 million computers could be purchased. Good computers.&nbsp;That&#8217;s enough computers to give a single computer to every kid in America&nbsp;from the age of 10 to 19 a computer, with several million to spare.</p><br />
<p>If the average fiction book costs $20, $95B could buy 19 books for every single person in America.</p><br />
<p>You could place a bag of about $10,000 in the center of every single square kilometer of land in the United States, just to see what happens.</p><br />
<p>You could cover every single bit of the country of Spain with a 3 inch layer of US Quarter Coins, each stack worth $7.00, 13 billion stacks in all.</p><br />
<p>I could go on all day. <a href="comments.cfm?id=440" target="">It&#8217;s your turn</a>.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Erik asked if I were for or against the war, and I couldn&#8217;t answer 100% either way. I&#8217;m certainly supportive of our troops &#8211; they&#8217;re real people taking real risks for the benefit of others. My grandfather was in World War II in an intelligence position (aka spy) and risked his life constantly for the benefit of our country. Putting sacrifice into perspective; I just spent two weeks away from my six month old daughter, and it was heart wrenching. My grandfather didn&#8217;t even get to see his first son born, let alone see him for the first six months of his life. I understand, if only for that one reason,&nbsp;the sacrifice soldiers are making&nbsp;for our country.</p>
<p>But, this is what&#8217;s keeping me from making a firm stand. I don&#8217;t think Iraq threatens our freedom. There&#8217;s a supposed link between Iraq and al Qaeda, but it is yet to be proven. But when I hear war supporters saying &#8220;We&#8217;re getting our revenge&#8221; it baffles me, because again, no link has been made. I&#8217;m also not for getting revenge. I&#8217;m for defending our freedom. I support hunting down al Qaeda not for revenge, but because they want to harm our country, and hunting them down is defensive. If the link is proven, and it&#8217;s compelling, I&#8217;ll support the war.</p>
<p>Right now, I think the war is a waste. I think we&#8217;re putting our troops at unneeded risk, making some pretty big waves in world politics, and spending an enourmous amount of money. If the link isn&#8217;t made between Iraq and al Qaeda, what good will the war do? We&#8217;ll spend at least $95 billion, our troops will occupy Iraq for years to come, our military will likely be spread thin, and the enemy will still be at large (with new enemies itching to hurt us).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Russell just reminded me of something that I think is important. People will ask sometimes &#8220;How did you get into doing web stuff?&#8221; and I&#8217;ll think about some of the stuff I was doing right before getting my first web related job. But that&#8217;s not exactly how I got into web stuff.</p>
<p>Before the web, there were bulletin board systems. You&#8217;d use your computer (or a terminal) and a modem to connect to another computer. Some BBSes allowed multiple connections, some only a single person at a time. I ran my own <span class="caps">BBS</span> for a long time, which, if anything, distracted me from the new and upcoming World Wide Web. The spider web analogies were annoying to me, so I was content to stay in my own&nbsp;comfortable <span class="caps">BBS</span> world.</p>
<p>One of the multi-lined BBSes I was a long time member of was dabbling in getting connected to the Internet. One of the users who was angling to be some kind of volunteer&nbsp;system operator decided to create a site for the <span class="caps">BBS</span>, using this new fangled <span class="caps">HTML</span>. I took a look at it his site, and decided it was crap, and being a cocky highschool junior, said so. He was terribly cocky himself, more so than I, and said something fateful:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see you do better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That phrase, and any variation of it with the same inherent meaning, has done more to fuel my drive and motivation than any other thing. I think it&#8217;s some kind of perverted arrogance. If someone says that to me, I really do set forth to do everything I can to actually do better than their expectations, and then some.</p>
<p>So when he said &#8220;Let&#8217;s see you do better&#8221; I went and did that. In 1993 I developed a website for the <span class="caps">BBS</span> that was standards compliant, looked good in every browser, and most importantly, was unarguably better than anything the challenging cocky bastard had come up with.</p>
<p>And now, ten years later, I think that drive and motivation has worn off some, but I think in part it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had anyone close really challenging me, really doubting my abilities. Carrie rolls her eyes sometimes, but she has no doubts. I need a worthy adversary, someone who thinks I&#8217;m full of crap. Someone who truly believes I cannot do something.</p>

<p>Are you an adversary?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past month alone, I&#8217;ve been on&nbsp;<strong>nine</strong> <p>airplanes. I can&#8217;t do it now, because it wasn&#8217;t prepared, but I think in the future, I&#8217;m going to begin interviewing the people sitting next to me on planes, because they&#8217;re all so different.</p><br />
<p>Last night between Orange County and San Jose, I sat next to someone who I thought would sleep the whole flight. Not so lucky. It turned out she was completely drunk, and liked to elbow me and say &#8220;So, you scared of flying&#8221;. I answered that question with a &#8220;no&#8221; three times, and just for giggles, said &#8220;oh yes, terrified&#8221; once. She wasn&#8217;t keeping track. </p><br />
<p>Due in part to her inebriated confusion, the noise on the plane, and the fact that she was too far gone to make any sound judgment, she ordered two straight rums, and downed them in four swallows cumalative. After the second drink, she asked me &#8220;Did he bring my drinks yet?&#8221; and I, detecting that she might be interested in having more, decided to lie. I told her that she had already had at least four straight rums, and that she was completely out of money. She agreed with me, and passed out mid sentence. The lady to my left and I had a discussion about the situation, and she commended me for tricking her into not drinking more.</p><br />
<p>On my second flight, the lady next to me had some kind of &#8220;pooping often&#8221; problem. I can only come to this conclusion because there was a smell involved. She had the window, I had the aisle, and in a span of 100 minutes, she got up at least <em>eight</em> times.</p><br />
<p>Now, upon giving it some thought and consideration, I figured something out. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is tweaked and freaked out in some way. You have just to sit next to me on a plane to find out how crazy you are.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an impressive <a href="http://enos.realimpact.net/calendar.php?caltype=8&amp;old=old" target="_self">example</a> <p>of group organization. I pains me to think that the energy these people expend will do little to stop a war where hundreds of thousands of our troops could benefit from their support instead. I respect those who stand for what they believe in, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But at this point efforts to stop the war by means of protest don&#8217;t seem effective. Perhaps unity might help&nbsp;hasten the end of the&nbsp;inevitable&nbsp;by boosting morale. </p><br />
<p>There&#8217;s no question morale reduces the loss of life for our troops. And perhaps because of the nature of technology and war, increased morale might&nbsp;result in a decrease in the lives of those we&#8217;re fighting against. The stated goals are to take out military targets and infrastructure that helps Saddam remain in power. If our troops can do their jobs with our support, perhaps this can finish quicker than we think.</p><br />
<p>I know it almost sounds like I&#8217;m suggesting that peace protests will be to blame for loss of life, but I don&#8217;t feel that to be true at all, don&#8217;t think it for a second.</p><br />
<p>Also, another thought I had: imagine the good that could be done if people rallied together and organized quickly and effeciently like they are for peace protests. Protesting the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2003/01/22_hlth.html" target="">failing health care system</a>, <a href="http://www.thehungersite.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/CTDSites" target="">helping feed the hungry</a>, fighting to save <a href="http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/schools/survey/participators.htm" target="">music and arts</a> in public schools, <a href="http://www.habitat.org/" target="">building homes</a> for the homeless, <a href="http://www.redcross.org/" target="">donating blood</a>, <a href="http://www.famlit.org/" target="">increasing literacy</a>; the list goes on. Take your pick, give it the same passion as a peace protest, and you&#8217;ll increase the peace more effectively than you would with peaceful or riotous protests.</p><a href="comments.cfm?id=436" target=""><br />
<p>What&#8217;s your take?</p></a></p>
